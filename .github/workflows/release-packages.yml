          PULL_REQUEST_TITLE: Deploy faustjs.org and example projects
          PULL_REQUEST_BODY: |
            New releases just landed in `canary`, so let's bring `main` up to speed!

            By syncing `main` with `canary` we are:

            1. Deploying the latest docs to faustjs.org.
            2. Updating the [examples](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/canary/examples) for users creating new projects.

            :warning: Make sure to **["Create a merge commit"](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/blob/3bb9b4e0f5b5406650df462f394d042c88af9f92/DEVELOPMENT.md?plain=1#L192)** when merging!
