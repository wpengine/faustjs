# WordPress Headless Framework (PREVIEW/ALPHA)

ðŸš§ **Note:** This project is in the early stages of development, but it does contain useful functionality for headless WordPress sites like plugins and npm packages that assist in authentication and previews.

## Quick Start

Eager to try out the Headless Framework? Here's how you can get started with our Preview example:

1. Create a WordPress site if you haven't already. We recommend using [Local](https://localwp.com/)!
2. Download, upload, and activate the `wpe-headless` plugin in this repository. [(Plugin Download)](https://wp-product-info.wpesvc.net/v1/plugins/wpe-headless?download)
3. Install [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) on the WordPress site if it's not already installed
4. [Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to a directory of your choice
5. Navigate to `examples/preview` in the cloned repository
6. `cp .env.local.sample .env.local`
7. Populate `WORDPRESS_URL` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL`) and `WPE_HEADLESS_SECRET` accordingly in `.env.local`
8. `npm install && npm run dev`

## Framework Features

- Headless Auth Flows
  - OAuth token authentication for users
  - Auth handler for Express/Next that exchanges a code for an access token. The access token can be used to make authenticated calls to WordPress via WPGraphQL or REST.
- [Previews](./docs/previews/README.md)
  - Rewrite preview and draft links in WP Admin to redirect to the frontend.
