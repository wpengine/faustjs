## Introduction

Faust.js is a framework for building front-end applications for headless WordPress sites. Faust.js provides tooling to reduce the pains of building a headless WordPress site (namely around data fetching, authentication, previews, and SSR/SSG) while offering a pleasant experience for both developers and publishers.

## Getting Started

Faust.js aims to be framework agnostic, so it can be used with any front-end framework. Visit one of the guides below for a starting point:

- [Getting started with Next.js](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/faustjs/next/getting-started)

As we work towards our first release, we will be introducing support for other frameworks.

## Documentation
