# WordPress Headless Framework (PREVIEW/ALPHA)

This project is in the early stages of development, but it does contain useful functionallity for headless WordPress sites like plugins and npm packages that assist in authentication and previews.

## Features

-   Headless Auth Flows
    -   OAuth token authentication for users
    -   Auth handler for Express/Next that exchanges a code for an access token. The access token can be used to make authenticated calls to WordPress via WPGraphQL or REST.
-   Previews
    -   Rewrite preview and draft links in WP Admin to redirect to the frontend.

## Project Structure

-   `/packages` - NPM packages
-   `/plugins` - WordPress Plugins
-   `/themes` - WordPress Themes (TBD)

# Contributing

Since we're in the early stages of development, we are not currently accepting outside contributions; although, we are interested in any problems that you encounter while using the framework.

Create an issue in this repository to report bugs or feature requests.

### Plugins

As this is a monorepo, you will not be able to check out this repository into `wp-content/themes` or `wp-content/plugins`.

Instead, you can create symlinks to the themes/plugins in this repository. Best of all, this will also sync your work
across multiple local sites!

### NPM Packages

When working on the NPM packages in this repository, you'll likely want to test them in a project that pulls them in
as dependencies.

To pull in your code changes into the dependent project, you can [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-link)
or [yarn link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link/). This will create symlinks from your dependent project's
`node_modules` directory into this repository.

**Note!** If using Next.js, you'll likely need to add [`next-transpile-modules`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules)
to your `next.config.js`. Without doing this, you may run errors such as `Error: Cannot find module 'react'`.
