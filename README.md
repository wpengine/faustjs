# Headless WordPress Framework

## Introduction

WP Engine's Headless WordPress Framework provides a set of tools to make building front-end applications with WordPress as the headless CMS a pleasant experience for both developers and publishers. This framework consists of a WordPress plugin, a set of npm packages, and guides to get you started building headless WordPress sites in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

_üöß **Note:** This project is in the early stages of development_

## Quick Start

Eager to try out the Headless Framework? Here's how you can get started:

### Create a front-end app

1. Create a new Next.js app from our [getting-started project](https://github.com/wpengine/headless-framework/tree/canary/examples/getting-started): `npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/wpengine/headless-framework/tree/canary --example-path examples/getting-started --use-npm`
2. `cd my-app && cp .env.local.sample .env.local` to create a file that contains your environment variables.
3. `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. See your site at http://localhost:3000.

### Point the app to your own WordPress site

The sample app loads WordPress content from our demo site at https://headlessfw.wpengine.com.

Point it to your own WordPress site instead:

1. Create a WordPress site if you haven't already. We recommend [Local](https://localwp.com/) to try things out locally, or you can use a live WordPress site.
2. Download, upload, and activate the `wpe-headless` plugin. [(Plugin Download)](https://wp-product-info.wpesvc.net/v1/plugins/wpe-headless?download)
3. Install [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) on the WordPress site if it's not already installed.

Then, in your front-end app directory:

4. Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` in `.env.local` to the full URL to your WordPress site, including the `http://` or `https://` prefix.
5. Change `WP_HEADLESS_SECRET` in `.env.local` to the secret key found at Settings ‚Üí Headless in your WordPress admin area.
6. `npm run dev` (kill and restart npm if it was already running)

You'll see the same site with your WordPress posts instead of ours.

To enable post previews, set your front-end app URL on the WordPress Settings ‚Üí Headless page (for example, `http://localhost:3000` when testing locally).
