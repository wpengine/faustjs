## Introduction

Faust.js is a framework for building front-end applications for headless WordPress sites. Faust.js provides tooling to reduce the pains of building a headless WordPress site (namely around data fetching, authentication, previews, and SSR/SSG) while offering a pleasant experience for both developers and publishers.

## Getting Started

Faust.js aims to be framework agnostic, so it can be used with any front-end framework. Visit one of the guides below for a starting point:

- [Getting started with Next.js](https://faustjs.org/docs/getting-started)

As we work towards our first release, we will be introducing support for other frameworks.

## System Requirements

- Node.js v16.0.0 or newer (v16.8.0 when using Next.js 13 and v18.17 when using Next.js 14).
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## Documentation

Visit [https://faustjs.org/docs/getting-started](https://faustjs.org/docs/getting-started) to view the full documentation.

## WordPress Plugin (FaustWP)

There are two key parts to Faust.js: the NPM packages and the WordPress plugin. To take full advantage of headless, you will need to install the plugin in addition to the npm packages.

You can download and install FaustWP from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/faustwp/), or by using the zip linked below.
