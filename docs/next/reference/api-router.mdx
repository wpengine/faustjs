title: Using the API Router
description: The API Router sets up the API routes for Faust.js.

The API Router is a node middleware that handles all of the Faust.js related API routes for you.

Currently, there are two API routes that are handled by the API Router:

- `auth/token`: A route to handle a request for an authentication token
- `auth/logout`: A route to handle a request to logout

With the API router, we have the ability to add more routes as needed, without requiring any changes from the user.

## Usage

By default, the API router is expected to be mounted at `/api/faust`. This is the base path that the API router will use to handle all of the routes (i.e. `/api/faust/auth/token`).

To configure this in Next.js, you would create a `faust` directory in your [api routes directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), with a [catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-routes) file named `[[...route]].ts`. The complete file path would then be:

```
src/pages/api/faust/[[...route]].ts
```

Now, add the following content to your newly created `[[...route]].ts` file:

```tsx title="src/pages/api/faust/[[...route]].ts"
import 'faust.config';
import { apiRouter } from '@faustjs/core/api';

export default apiRouter;
```

Your API Router is now setup and ready to handle all Faust.js related API routes from `/api/faust/*`.

### Modifying the API Router Base Path

You may find a need to modify the base path of the API Router. For these use cases, the `apiBasePath` config option can be used.

Say for example, you want to mount the API router at `/api/headless`. You would first specify this base path in your `faust.config.ts` file:

```js title="faust.config.js" {15}
import { config as coreConfig } from '@faustjs/core';

if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL) {
  console.error(
    'You must provide a NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL environment variable, did you forget to load your .env.local file?',
  );
}

/**
 * @type {import("@faustjs/core").Config}
 */
export default coreConfig({
  wpUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL,
  apiClientSecret: process.env.FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY,
  apiBasePath: '/api/headless',
});
```

Then, you would replicate this path in your Next.js [API routes directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), by creating a `headless` directory, and adding a `[[...route]].ts` file to it. The complete file path would then be:

```
src/pages/api/headless/[[...route]].ts
```

Finally, the content of `src/pages/api/headless/[[...route]].ts` would be:

```ts title="src/pages/api/headless/[[...route]].ts"
import 'faust.config';
import { apiRouter } from '@faustjs/core/api';

export default apiRouter;
```

Your API Router will now be handling all Faust.js related API routes from `/api/headless/*`.
