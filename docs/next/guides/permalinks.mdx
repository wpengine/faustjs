Permalinks are the "pretty URLs" of your individual blog post or page on your WordPress site. Permalinks can be modified by going to WP Admin -> Settings -> Permalinks. From there, you can modify the options to change the permalink structure to your liking.

Faust.js does not make any opinions about the structure of your permalinks. Instead, your permalinks should map to the layout of your Next.js `pages`.

For example, your permalink structure might look like this in WordPress:

```
/posts/%postname%/
```

Therefore, your Next.js pages structure should look like this:

```
my-app/
  pages/
    _app.tsx
    index.tsx
    posts/
      [postSlug].tsx
  next-env.d.ts
  package-lock.json
  package.json
  README.md
  tsconfig.json
```

Notice the `posts` directory and the accompanying `[postSlug].tsx` file.
