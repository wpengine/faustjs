title: Setting Up Post and Page Previews
description: View WordPress preview post/page content on your headless frontend with Faust.js
---

Faust.js has support for page and post previews. This allows you to view your WordPress content on the headless frontend as drafts or even before publishing.

## Set Your Headless Secret

Your headless secret is a value that is used to authenticate requests to WordPress. This enables you to view content that isn't yet published, on your Next.js frontend.

### Copy your Headless Secret

Your headless secret can be found in WP Admin -> Settings -> Headless. Copy this value.

### Add your Headless Secret to your `.env` File

Add the `WP_HEADLESS_SECRET` key to your `.env` file with the headless secret as the value. Your `.env` file should already have a value for either `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` or `WORDPRESS_URL`. The file should look something like this:

```bash title=.env {13}
# Either WORDPRESS_URL or NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL need to be populated. Not both!
#
# (Recommended) Setting WORDPRESS_URL instead of NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL will limit requests to the WordPress backend
# to only come from the Node.js server.
#
# Setting NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL instead of WORDPRESS_URL will allow requests to come from the client-side which may
# reduce site performance and put extra load on the WordPress backend.

NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=http://localhost:8080
# WORDPRESS_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Plugin secret found in WordPress Settings->Headless
WP_HEADLESS_SECRET=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
```

### Ensure your Headless Secret is Passed to `headlessConfig`

Typically, your Next.js app will have `headlessConfig` set in the `_app.tsx` file. The headless secret is passed via the `apiClientSecret` key. Make sure it is being set:


```tsx title=_app.tsx {8}
import { headlessConfig } from '@faustjs/core';
import { HeadlessProvider } from '@faustjs/next';
import { client } from 'client';
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';

headlessConfig({
  wpUrl: process.env.WORDPRESS_URL || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL,
  apiClientSecret: process.env.WP_HEADLESS_SECRET,
});

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <HeadlessProvider client={client} pageProps={pageProps}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </HeadlessProvider>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Create the Authorize Handler

Next, you will need to create the `authorizeHandler`. This authenticates requests from WordPress. Create a page at `/src/pages/api/auth/wpe-headless.ts` with the following:

```ts
import { authorizeHandler } from '@faustjs/core';

export default authorizeHandler;
```

## Create your Preview Page

With your headless secret set and the `authorizeHandler` ready to handle requests, you can now create a Next.js [page](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for previews. Create a file at `/src/pages/preview.tsx` with the following:

```tsx title=src/pages/preview.tsx
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { PageComponent } from './[...pageUri]';
import type { Page, Post } from '@faustjs/core';
import { PostComponent } from './posts/[postSlug]';
import { client } from 'client';

export default function Preview() {
  const { query } = useRouter();
  const { usePreview } = client;

  // Use the "p" and "page_id" queries to determine if the preview is a post or page
  const { p, page_id } = query;
  const isPage = !!page_id;

  // Get the post or page from the usePreview hook.
  const postOrPage: unknown = usePreview({
    pageId: isPage ? (p as string) : undefined,
    postId: !isPage ? (p as string) : undefined,
  } as any);

  if (postOrPage === null) {
    return <>Not Found</>;
  }

  /**
   * Below we return a <PageComponent /> or <PostComponent /> based
   * on the preview type. We do this to maintain a consistent experience throughout
   * previews and actual page/post renders.
   */

  // If the preview is for a page, return a "page" component
  if (isPage) {
    return <PageComponent page={postOrPage as Page} />;
  }

  // Otherwise, return the "post" component
  return <PostComponent post={postOrPage as Post} />;
}
```

Let's break down what is going on here:

First we are getting the `p` and `page_id` values from the Next.js Router `query`:

```tsx {2}
const { query } = useRouter();
const { p, page_id } = query;
const isPage = !!page_id;
```

We then use these values in our `usePreview` hook to fetch the correct post or page:

```tsx
const postOrPage: unknown = usePreview({
    pageId: isPage ? (p as string) : undefined,
    postId: !isPage ? (p as string) : undefined,
} as any);
```

Finally, based on whether `isPage` is `true`, we will return a `<PageComponent />` or `<PostComponent />` respectively.

```tsx
if (postOrPage === null) {
    return <>Not Found</>;
}

if (isPage) {
    return <PageComponent page={postOrPage as Page} />;
}

return <PostComponent post={postOrPage as Post} />;
```

We abstract the page and post layouts into components to be reusable so there is no divergence between preview pages/posts and actual pages/posts.

## Navigating to Preview Pages

Start by logging into your WordPress Admin. For this example, we'll create a new post.

So far, I've added a title and a simple line of text for the content. To view this post as a preview on your frontend, click the **Preview** link (1). From there, click, **Preview in new tab** (2):

<img src="/docs/img/post-preview.png" alt="WordPress post page using the Gutenberg editor with a red arrow to the preview and preview in new tab dropdowns" />

Notice the **Publish** button is also visible. This means the post has not been published yet and can not be viewed on the frontend without being authenticated.

Clicking on **Preview in new tab** should take you to your post preview page with the current preview content:

<img src="/docs/img/post-preview-frontend.png" alt="Post preview on the frontend in Next.js" />
