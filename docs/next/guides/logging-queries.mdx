title: Logging Queries
description: You can log all the queries that are executed in Faust.js
---

In a development environment, you may want to log GraphQL queries that are being executed in your application. Faust.js provides a function, `logQueries`, to do this.

`logQueries` is called within your `client/index.ts` file. Take the following `client/index.ts` example:

```ts title="client/index.ts" {23-25}
/**
 * GQTY: You can safely modify this file and Query Fetcher based on your needs
 */
import type { IncomingMessage } from 'http';
import { getClient } from '@faustjs/next';
import {
  generatedSchema,
  scalarsEnumsHash,
  GeneratedSchema,
  SchemaObjectTypes,
  SchemaObjectTypesNames,
} from './schema.generated';

export const client = getClient<
  GeneratedSchema,
  SchemaObjectTypesNames,
  SchemaObjectTypes
>({
  schema: generatedSchema,
  scalarsEnumsHash,
});

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    logQueries(client);
}

export function serverClient(req: IncomingMessage) {
  return getClient<GeneratedSchema, SchemaObjectTypesNames, SchemaObjectTypes>({
    schema: generatedSchema,
    scalarsEnumsHash,
    context: req,
  });
}

export * from './schema.generated';
```

Note the conditional check for the node environment. It is recommended that you only log queries in a dev environment, and not in production.

Additionally, the `logQueries` function returns a function than can be called to turn off the logger:

```ts
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  const unsubscribe = logQueries(client);

  // queries are now logging
  // ...

  unsubscribe();

  // queries no longer log
  // ...
}
```
