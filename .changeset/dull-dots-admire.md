'@faustwp/cli': minor
---

Added new telemetry commands: `faust telemetry status`, `faust telemetry enable`, & `faust telemetry disable`.
These new commands replace `faust faust-telemetry`, which previously required additional user interation.
Removed `FAUST_NO_INTERACTION` as the CLI no longer requires interaction.
