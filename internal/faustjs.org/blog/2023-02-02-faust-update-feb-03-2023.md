We're off to the races with new releases, new features, bug fixes and more. It's been an incredibly productive two weeks for the Faust.js team and we're just getting started!

<!--truncate-->

## Windows developers rejoice!

First, I'm happy to announce that we've fixed the build issues that were plaguing Windows developers and Faust.js should now build on the platform. If you do encounter any issues on Windows in the future, please do [submit an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/issues).

## Gutenberg block code available

Next, I'm thrilled to announce that all our code for building with Gutenberg in Faust is now available. This requires two pieces to function. First is a [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) that breaks down blocks in WordPress so that your Faust.js app can process them. The second is [a new package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faustwp/blocks) that helps you reconstruct and control blocks in your app. While you can play with these today I am afraid not all the documentation has been published yet. Expect to see a getting started guide and more documentation in the coming weeks at [Faustjs.org](https://faustjs.org).

## A new "debug" mode

We've introduced a new "debug" mode which can be triggered by adding `FAUST_DEBUG=true` to your `.env.local` file. This new mode will give you a deeper insight to what Faust is doing behind the scenes including debugging for remote calls and more. We hope it will make it that much easier for you to build with Faust.

## Need Faust.js support?

Finally, I wanted to call out that support for Faust is available in two places, our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/J2khkF9XYK) and our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/canary/packages). Please do submit issues, ask your questions and, ultimately, help us make sure that Faust.js is exactly what you need to build headless sites on WordPress.

## What's next?

Next up we're finished the Gutenberg blocks documentation and preparing for [DE{CODE}](https://events.wpengine.com/event/b1c1e30f-2c73-4abb-a609-52afaed68717/websitePage:efdb2b4b-9c33-43ea-8831-a841975fef2c?_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8B-2mHTmk6kfJOYT5KGvL9ipKFFhOczQg-91hzmbvgqKHLv_WhYUAQAfo3vyReHcOfohV4RUEVL3ydNOuj--ldJgBbbwPZxnJG-Y2Vgz1hedENKQ0&_hsmi=242239523&utm_campaign=23q1_wpe_decode%20&utm_content=register_now_link&utm_medium=email&utm_source=hubspot), WP Engine's virtual developers conference coming next month. We've got a lot of great content planned for Faust.js and Atlas so, if you're still on the fence on how this can help you build headless sites, register for DE{CODE} (it's free) and let us show you what it can do!

Finally, we're also deep in the weeds of bringing a headless version of the [WordPress Toolbar](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/toolbar/) to Faust.js. This will allow users to edit content and do all of the things the core WordPress version does but with a focus on headless development. This means that things that don't matter to headless users won't clutter the toolbar and, in the coming months, we'll be able to add features such as seeing the build status, clear caches and more, right from your app. We're pretty excited at what it will do for making it easier to manage a headless WordPress site and I hope you are too!
