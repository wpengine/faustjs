Sitemaps can be a complicated process when using WordPress in a headless environment. Thankfully, Faust takes care of all your sitemap needs through a simple function, [`getSitemapProps`](/docs/reference/getSitemapProps).

## How It Works

`getSitemapProps` works by proxying your existing sitemaps from WordPress to your frontend, while replacing any WordPress URLs with your headless frontend's URL.

This means there is no constraints in how your sitemaps are created on WordPress, giving you the flexibility to use plugins such as [Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) or [XML Sitemaps](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/). As long as your WordPress sitemaps matches the following criteria, they will be proxied:

- Conform to the [XML Sitemaps specification](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html)
- Has `sitemap` in their pathname (ex. `/page-sitemap.xml`)
- Has `.xml` as their extension

## Setup

To get started, create `sitemap.xml.js` in your `pages` directory with the following content:

```js title="pages/sitemap.xml.js"
import { getSitemapProps } from '@faustwp/core';

export default function Sitemap() {}

export function getServerSideProps(ctx) {
  return getSitemapProps(ctx, {
    frontendUrl: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
  });
}
```

`getSitemapProps` accepts two required arguments. The first is the `ctx` object passed from `getServerSideProps`, and the second is the [`getSitemapProps` configuration object](/docs/reference/getSitemapProps#config). There is only one required property in the configuration object, and it's the `frontendUrl`. This is the URL to your frontend Faust site. In the example above, we are reference this from the environment. You can do the same by setting the `process.env.FRONTEND_URL` environment variable.

This is all the configuration you need to get started. As you can see, if you now go to `/sitemap.xml` on your headless frontend, you will see the sitemap index file being proxied over with properly formatted URLs.

## Additional Configuration

### Ignoring Paths

There will be instances in which you don't want to proxy over a specific path. For example, if you have a custom post type that you want to exclude from your sitemap, you can do so by adding it to the `sitemapPathsToIgnore` array.

```js title="pages/sitemap.xml.js" {8}
import { getSitemapProps } from '@faustwp/core';

export default function Sitemap() {}

export function getServerSideProps(ctx) {
  return getSitemapProps(ctx, {
    frontendUrl: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
    sitemapPathsToIgnore: ['/wp-sitemap-users-1.xml'],
  });
}
```

You can additionally use a wildcard to ignore sitemap paths that may be paginated:

```js title="pages/sitemap.xml.js" {8}
import { getSitemapProps } from '@faustwp/core';

export default function Sitemap() {}

export function getServerSideProps(ctx) {
  return getSitemapProps(ctx, {
    frontendUrl: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
    sitemapPathsToIgnore: ['/wp-sitemap-users-*'],
  });
}
```

### Defining Next.js Pages for Sitemaps

The above code examples account for adding your WordPress content to your sitemap, but what about the file based pages you've created in Next.js? Say for an example we have `src/pages/about.tsx` and we'd like to include it in our sitemap. That can be done by creating a `pages` property in the `getSitemapProps` config object:

```js title="pages/sitemap.xml.js" {8-12}
import { getSitemapProps } from '@faustwp/core';

export default function Sitemap() {}

export function getServerSideProps(ctx) {
  return getSitemapProps(ctx, {
    frontendUrl: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
    pages: [
      {
        path: '/about',
      },
    ],
  });
}
```

The `path` property is a relative path to the page you want to include in your sitemap and is the only required field. Take a look at the [reference doc](/docs/reference/getSitemapProps#config) for more of the available options.

## Examples

Below you can find some drop in examples for different XML Sitemap configurations on WordPress.

:::note

Be sure to define your `pages` property in your `getSitemapProps` config object if you have any Next.js specific pages you want included in your sitemap.

### Usage with default WordPress Sitemaps

Below is a drop in configuration using default WordPress sitemaps. This assumes you want to ignore the "users" sitemap:

```js title="pages/sitemap.xml.js"
import { getSitemapProps } from '@faustwp/core';

export default function Sitemap() {}

export function getServerSideProps(ctx) {
  return getSitemapProps(ctx, {
    frontendUrl: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
    sitemapPathsToIgnore: ['/wp-sitemap-users-*'],
  });
}
```

### Usage with Yoast

Below is a drop in configuration using Yoast's sitemap. This assumes you want to ignore the "author" sitemap:

```js title="pages/sitemap.xml.js"
import { getSitemapProps } from '@faustwp/core';

export default function Sitemap() {}

export function getServerSideProps(ctx) {
  return getSitemapProps(ctx, {
    frontendUrl: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
    sitemapPathsToIgnore: ['/author-sitemap.xml'],
  });
}
```
