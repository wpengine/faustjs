# Getting Started with Faust

## Quick Start

To create a Faust project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app \
    -e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/main \
    --example-path examples/next/faustwp-getting-started \
    --use-npm
```

Now, `cd` into your new app and copy the sample environment template:

```bash
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
```

Finally, run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your new project.

Currently, the posts and pages you see are coming from our WordPress site at [https://faustexample.wpengine.com](https://faustexample.wpengine.com). In the next step, we'll show you how to hook up your own WordPress site.

## Connecting your WordPress site

The example app above loads WordPress content from the demo site at [https://faustexample.wpengine.com](https://faustexample.wpengine.com).

To point it to a different WordPress site, first, make sure you have installed and activated the necessary WordPress plugins:

- [Faust](https://wordpress.org/plugins/faustwp/)
- [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)

Once the necessary plugins have been installed, open the `.env.local` file you created earlier, it should look something like this:

```bash
# Your WordPress site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=https://faustexample.wpengine.com

# Plugin secret found in WordPress Settings->Headless
# FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_PLUGIN_SECRET
```

Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` value with your WordPress site URL (be sure to include `http://` or `https://`).

Additionally, update the `FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY` value with the secret key found in Settings â†’ Faust in your WordPress admin area to support previews.

## Check Your Permalinks

Finally, ensure your permalink structure in `WP Admin -> Settings -> Permalinks` **is not** set to "plain":

<img
  src="/docs/img/permalinks.png"
  alt="WordPress Admin Settings Page for Permalinks"
/>

Faust resolves templates similar to the Template Hierarchy in WordPress, but "plain" permalinks are not supported due to constraints in Next.js.

## Start Editing

With your project created and development environment started, edit `wp-templates/front-page.js` and see the updated results in your browser.
