# Getting Started with Faust

## System Requirements

First, make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- Node.js v16.0.0 or newer (v16.8.0 when using Next.js 13).
- MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## Quick Start

To create a Faust project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app \
    -e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/main \
    --example-path examples/next/faustwp-getting-started \
    --use-npm
```

Now, `cd` into your new app and copy the sample environment template:

```bash
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
```

Finally, run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your new project.

Currently, the posts and pages you see are coming from our WordPress site at [https://faustexample.wpengine.com](https://faustexample.wpengine.com). In the next step, we'll show you how to hook up your own WordPress site.

## Connecting Your WordPress Site

The example app above loads WordPress content from the demo site at [https://faustexample.wpengine.com](https://faustexample.wpengine.com).

To point it to a different WordPress site, first, make sure you have installed and activated the necessary WordPress plugins:

- [Faust](https://wordpress.org/plugins/faustwp/)
- [WPGraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/)

Once the necessary plugins have been installed, open the `.env.local` file you created earlier, it should look something like this:

```bash
# Your WordPress site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=https://faustexample.wpengine.com

# Plugin secret found in WordPress Settings->Headless
FAUST_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_PLUGIN_SECRET
```

:::note

If you are using a version of Faust previous to 0.2.1, use `FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY` instead of `FAUST_SECRET_KEY`.

:::

Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` value with your WordPress site URL (be sure to include `http://` or `https://`).

Additionally, update the `FAUST_SECRET_KEY` value with the secret key found in Settings â†’ Faust in your WordPress admin area to support previews.

**Note for Atlas Users**: if deploying from the Atlas portal using your own repository without beginning with a blueprint, you will need to set your environment variables manually. Learn how by taking a look at our [FAQs](/docs/faq).

## Set your Front-end Site URL

To ensure certain features of Faust function as expected, such as previews, be sure to set the Front-end Site URL in the Faust WordPress Plugin Settings. It is the URL to your headless front-end. This is used for authenticated post previews and for rewriting links to point to your front-end site.

1. Navigate to the `Faust WordPress Plugin` settings page
2. Enter in the base url of your headless WordPress site, i.e. http://localhost:3000 or http://www.mysiteurl.com in the Front-end site URL setting

3. Click `Save Changes`


## Check Your Permalinks

Finally, ensure your permalink structure in `WP Admin -> Settings -> Permalinks` **is not** set to "plain":

  alt="WordPress Admin Settings Page for Permalinks"
/>

Faust resolves templates similar to the Template Hierarchy in WordPress, but "plain" permalinks are not supported due to constraints in Next.js.

## Start Editing

With your project created and development environment started, edit `wp-templates/front-page.js` and see the updated results in your browser.
