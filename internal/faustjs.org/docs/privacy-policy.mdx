## Faust's relationship with optional user data collection

(Updated: Oct 11, 2022.)

WPEngine, Inc. (“WP Engine,” “we,” “us,” “our”) maintains this Privacy Policy to inform you of our practices with regard to personal data we collect from or about you in connection with our web site (the “Site”) or through the provision of our services (the “Services”). We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material change by providing a notice on our web site or, if you are a customer, by whatever other means upon which we have mutually agreed. The current version of this Privacy Policy may be found at [https://wpengine.com/legal/privacy/](https://wpengine.com/legal/privacy/). By using the Site or the Services you acknowledge your consent to the practices described herein.

If you are a customer who is subject to the privacy laws of California or the European Union, the Data Privacy Addendum located at [https://wpengine.com/legal/dpa/](https://wpengine.com/legal/dpa/) as it may be updated from time to time governs the obligations between us with regard to personal data as defined by such laws.

1.  **Personal data we collect**
    1.  **Information you give us**

        In order for you to use our Services and other features of our Site, we will ask you for some of your personal data (e.g. contact information, name, etc.). The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who would like to comment on our blog to provide a username. Those who purchase Services from us are asked to provide additional information including, as necessary, the personal and financial information required to process transactions. In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us. You can always refuse to supply personal data; however, doing so may prevent you from receiving our Services or engaging in other activities on the Site. In no event will we ever request sensitive personal data (e.g. health information, religious preferences, etc.) from you, and we expressly request that you not provide any such sensitive personal data to us.
    2.  **Web server logs**

        As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically through your use of the Site. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, the files viewed on the Site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site. We use analytical software to help us understand this information. This software sends information to its licensor. Other sites and companies may also use this software. As a result, the licensor may collect information that, when aggregated by them, allows them to identify you individually. We have no responsibility for this collection and use.
    3.  **Cookies**

        We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. Ads appearing on our Site may be delivered to you by advertising partners who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. However, data tracking files used by us may also be used by these advertisers and, when combined with other information held by them, be used to identify you personally. For more information on third party cookies and instructions on how to opt-out of those cookies set by members of the National Advertising Initiative, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Or, if you are located in the European Union, please visit the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).

    Rights
    **To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights
    described above, you can contact us by email at legal@wpengine.com or by
    phone at (877) 973-6446. Only you, or a person registered with the
    California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf,
    may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal
    information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf
    of your minor child.

    You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or
    data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer
    request must:

    1.  Provide sufficient information that allows us to
        reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected
        personal information or an authorized representative.
    2.  Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows
        us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

    We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
    information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the
    request and confirm the personal information relates to you. We will
    only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request
    to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

    **Response Timing and Format
    **We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within
    45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of
    the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written
    response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we
    provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of
    your request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we
    cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability
    requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information
    that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information
    from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by
    electronic mail communication.

    We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your
    verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
    manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee,
    we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
    estimate before completing your request.

    **Non-Discrimination
    **We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of
    your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

    1.  Deny you goods or services.
    2.  Charge you different prices or rates for goods or
        services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or
        imposing penalties.
    3.  Provide you a different level or quality of goods or
        services.
    4.  Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate
        for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or
        services.

    However, we may offer you certain financial incentives
    permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or
    quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will
    reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain
    written terms that describe the program’s material aspects.
    Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt
    in consent, which you may revoke at any time.

    California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section §
    1798.83) permits users of our Website that are California residents to
    request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal
    information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To
    make such a request, please send us an electronic message through our
    website or write us at our address listed on our webpage.
