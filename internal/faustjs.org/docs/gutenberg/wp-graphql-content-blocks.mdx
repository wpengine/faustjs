title: Getting started with wp-graphql-content-blocks
---

It is recommended that you install `wp-graphql-content-blocks` plugin that allows querying gutenberg blocks with wp-graphql.
This should be used in conjunction with `@faustwp/blocks` package as a lot of conventions we use are designed with those tools in mind.
This plugin is similar to the `wp-graphql-gutenberg` but it is actively maintained and tackles some scalability issues of the former.

## Introduction

Head over to the [github repo](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks) and dowload the plugin as a zip file.

Install the plugin into your `wp-content/plugins` on a brand new WordPress installation.

Within the `wp-graphql-content-blocks-main` plugin folder use composer to install the vendor dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```
Activate the plugin within WordPress plugins page:

  src="/docs/img/activate-wp-graphql-content-plugin.png"
  alt="The plugin actication page in WordPress"
/>

There is no other configuration needed once you install the plugin.

## Getting started

Once the plugin is installed, head over to the GraphiQL IDE and you should be able to perform queries for the block data (This plugin is an extension of [wp-graphql](https://www.wpgraphql.com/), so make sure you have it installed first.).
There is a new field added in the Post and Page models called `contentBlocks`.
This represents a list of available blocks for that content type:

<img
  src="/docs/img/querying-with-content-blocks.png"
  alt="Example query for contentBlocks using GraphiQL IDE"
/>

If you search in GraphiQL's documentation explorer tab for the `contentBlocks` type you will be able to see the available block fields.
The most important ones are:

* `renderedHTML`: It's the HTML of the block as rendered by the [render_block](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/render_block/) function.
* `name`: The actual name of the block taken from it's `block.json` spec.
* `__typename`: The type of block transformed from the `name` field in camel-case notation.
* `apiVersion`: The apiVersion of the block taken from its `block.json` spec.
* `innerBlocks`: The innerblock list of that block.
* `isDynamic`: Whether the block is dynamic or not, taken from its `block.json` spec.
* `nodeId`, `parentId`: Unique identifiers for the block and the parent of the block. We will explain their usage later.


## How does the plugin work?

The plugin essentially iterates over the whole list of `block.json` types as registered within WordPress
and creates WPGraphQL types and resolvers based on that specification.
As long as your blocks use the [register_block_type](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/register_block_type/) function passing a `block.json`, it will be available in the system without any extra steps.

As an example, we are given the following `block.json` definition of a block:

```json title="block.json"
{
    "$schema": "https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/block.json",
    "apiVersion": 2,
    "name": "my-plugin/notice",
    "icon": "star",
    "version": "1.0.3",
    "attributes": {
        "message": {
            "type": "string",
            "source": "html",
            "selector": ".message"
        }
    }
}
```

The plugin will create the following WPGraphQL type:

```
type MyPluginNoticeAttributes {
	message: String;
}
type MyPluginNotice {
	attributes: MyPluginNoticeAttributes;
}
```

When you request to resolve the `message` attribute for `MyPluginNotice`, the plugin will use a resolver that tries to extract the field by sourcing the text element using the `selector`. For example, given the following HTML:
this field by sourcing the text element using the `selector`. For example given the following HTML:

```
<div class="message">Hello World</div>
```

Since the `block.json` message attribute uses the `.message` selector to source the text for that field, this will resolve to:

`"Hello World"`

Currently the plugin handles the following attribute types taken from the [reference list](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-attributes/):

* boolean
* number
* integer
* string

:::note
If you see a specific attribute missing that you need for your project, please open a [new Feature Request](https://github.com/wpengine/wp-graphql-content-blocks/issues/new) so that the Faust team can make it available for you.

## How to query block data?

To query specific block data you need to define that data in the `contentBlock` as the appropriate type.
For example to use `CoreParagraph` attributes you need to use the following query:

```graphql {17}
{
  posts {
    nodes {
      contentBlocks {
        __typename
        name
        ...on CoreParagraph {
          attributes {
            content
            className
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If the resolved block has values for those fields, it will return them, otherwise it will return `null`.

```json
{
	"__typename" : "CoreParagraph",
	"name": "core/paragraph",
	"attributes": {
    	"content": "Hello world",
    	"className": null
	}
}
```

## What about innerBlocks?

In order to facilitate querying `innerBlocks` fields more efficiently you want to use `contentBlocks(flat: true)` instead of `contentBlocks`.
By passing this argument, all the blocks available (both blocks and innerBlocks) will be returned all flattened in the same list.

For example, given the following HTML Content:

```html
<columns>
	<column>
		<p>Example paragraph in Column<p>
	</column>
<column>
```

It will return the following blocks:

```json
[
	{
	  "__typename": "CoreColumns",
		"name": "core/columns",
		"id": "63dbec9abcf9d",
		"parentId": null
	},
	{
	  "__typename": "CoreColumn",
	  "name": "core/column",
	  "id": "63dbec9abcfa6",
      "parentId": "63dbec9abcf9d"
	},
	{
	  "__typename": "CoreParagraph",
	  "name": "core/paragraph",
	  "id": "63dbec9abcfa9",
      "parentId": "63dbec9abcfa6",
	  "attributes": {
	    "content": "Example paragraph in Column 1",
	    "className": null
	  }
	}
]
```

The `CoreColumns` contains one or more `CoreColumn` block, and each `CoreColumn` contains a `CoreParagraph`.
If we were to create a query to resolve this hierarchy, we would have to use:

```graphql
contentBlocks {
    __typename
    name
    ...on CoreColumns {
		innerBlocks {
			...on CoreColumn {
				...on CoreParagraph {
					attributes {
						content
						className
					}
				}
			}
		}
    }
}
```

This clearly becomes an scalability issue as we don't really know how many levels deep can we use for those types. It could be two levels or it could be 50. Using [block patterns](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/) for example posses a real issue.
In each case we would have to copy the whole fragment list again and again. This is one of the shorfalls of `wp-graphql-gutenberg` plugin but with this plugin we have a more elegant solution.

This is how you request all blocks as a flat list:

```graphql
contentBlocks(flat:true) {
    __typename
    name
	id: nodeId
	parentId
    ... on CoreColumns {
        attributes {
        	className
        }
    }
	... on CoreColumn {
        attributes {
        	className
        }
    }
	...on CoreParagraph {
		attributes {
			content
			className
		}
	}
}
```

Given the flattened list of blocks though, how can you put it back? Well that's where you use the
`nodeId` and `parentId` fields to assign temporary unique ids for each block.

The `nodeId` field assigns a temporary unique id for a specific block and the `parentId` will
be assigned only if the current block has a parent. If the current block does have a parent, it will get the parent's `nodeId` value.

So in order to put everything back in the Headless site, you want to use the `flatListToHierarchical` function as mentioned in the [WPGraphQL docs](https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/menus#hierarchical-data).

This way you can reconstruct the block tree as before and pass it on to the `WordPressBlocksViewer` component:

```js
import { WordPressBlocksViewer } from '@faustwp/blocks';
import flatListToHierarchical from '../utilities/flatListToHierarchical';
...
const { contentBlocks } = props.data.post;
const blocks = flatListToHierarchical(contentBlocks);

<WordPressBlocksViewer contentBlocks={blocks} />
...
```
:::note
Currently the `nodeId` field is only unique per request and is not persisted anywhere. If you perform another request each block will be assigned a new `nodeId` each time.
