title: Creating a Block from the WordPress Blocks list
description: This tutorial will give you some simple steps to follow to create a Block from the official WordPress Blocks list
---

In this tutorial you will install and create a block using `@faustwp/blocks`. It will use data from the official Blocks that are available in the block editor of your WordPress site.

## Prerequisites

You will need to complete both of these guides before you can create blocks with this tutorial. Make sure you have the latest version of `Faust` and `@faustwp/blocks` installed if you have already completed these guides in the past.

1. [Faust Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started)
2. [Blocks Getting Started Guide](/docs/gutenberg/getting-started)

## 1. Choose a block to implement

:::info

The Core Editor Blocks contain a list of useful blocks for editing and publishing content. All of the official blocks include a `block.json` with defined attributes, so the `wp-graphql-content-blocks` plugin will automatically expose those as GraphQL fields.

:::

For this tutorial, we are going to implement the [Code Block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/core-blocks/#code) that renders a formatted block of code.

/>

## 2. Review the Code Block in the Editor

Before you try to implement the block, it's useful to get an idea of how the block is configured within the editor. You want to create a few sample blocks and test their options.

Navigate to your WordPress instance and create a New Post. Add a Block into the Post. For this tutorial it will be the Code Block shown below:

<a href="/docs/img/core-code-block-preview.png" target="_blank">
  <img src="/docs/img/core-code-block-preview.png" alt="Code Block Preview" />
</a>

:::info

You can expand the block sidebar options to change some of its styling. For example, you can configure the Color, Dimensions, Border, and Size settings for the Code Block.

Once you get familiar with the block's look and feel, let's explore its attributes from the GraphiQL IDE.

:::

## 3. Review the Block data and attributes in the GraphiQL IDE

:::info

<img src="/docs/img/graphiql-ide.png" alt="GraphiQL IDE" />

The GraphiQL IDE link will show in the Admin Bar of your WordPress instance if you
have properly installed WPGraphQL from the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started).
:::

### 3.1. Search GraphiQL IDE Docs for `CoreCode`

Within the GraphiQL IDE, use the Docs to find the `CoreCode` Block to display its type and properties. If you chose a different Block, then search for that type instead.

After searching the Docs for `CoreCode` and clicking on `CoreCodeAttributes`, you will see the following:

<img
  src="/docs/img/core-code-block-ide-attributes.png"
  alt="Code Block Block attributes documentation in GraphiQL IDE"
/>

### 3.2. Inspect the block data via the GraphiQL IDE

You can use the following query in the GraphiQL IDE to inspect the Block data. Replace `/posts/testing` with the path to your post.

```graphql
{
  post(id: "/posts/testing", idType: URI) {
    editorBlocks {
      renderedHtml
      ... on CoreCode {
        attributes {
          borderColor
          backgroundColor
          content
          style
          textColor
          fontSize
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will resolve into:

```
"data": {
    "post": {
      "editorBlocks": [
        {
          "renderedHtml": "\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code has-border-color has-tertiary-background-color has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size\" style=\"border-color:#333333;border-width:2px;color:#333333\"><code>// Computes the nth Fibonacci number\nfunction fib(n) {\n    var a = 0, b = 1, c;\n    if (n &lt; 3) {\n        if (n &lt; 0) return fib(-n);\n        if (n === 0) return 0;\n        return 1;\n    }\n    while (--n)\n        c = a + b, a = b, b = c;\n    return c;\n}</code></pre>\n",
          "attributes": {
            "borderColor": null,
            "backgroundColor": "tertiary",
            "content": "// Computes the nth Fibonacci number\nfunction fib(n) {\n    var a = 0, b = 1, c;\n    if (n &lt; 3) {\n        if (n &lt; 0) return fib(-n);\n        if (n === 0) return 0;\n        return 1;\n    }\n    while (--n)\n        c = a + b, a = b, b = c;\n    return c;\n}",
            "style": "{\"color\":{\"text\":\"#333333\"},\"border\":{\"color\":\"#333333\",\"width\":\"2px\"}}",
            "textColor": null,
            "fontSize": "small"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
```

:::info

Notice that with some of the attributes like `backgroundColor`, the editor used the `theme.json` palette slug name instead of the actual value, i.e. `tertiary`. It also stored the custom hardcoded styles in the `style` fields as a JSON string. We will have to handle them appropriately when developing the associated block.

Once you get familiar with how to query the necessary data from that block, let's see how to implement the block in your Faust Headless site.

:::

## 4. Create the initial block and log the attributes

Follow the steps below to create a `CoreCode` block that logs its attributes in the console.

### 4.1 Create a `wp-blocks` folder in your Headless Site root

<img src="/docs/img/wp-blocks-folder.png" alt="wp-blocks folder" />

### 4.2 Create the `CoreCode.js` inside the `wp-blocks` folder

```jsx title="wp-blocks/CoreCode.js"
// import react
import React from 'react';
// create CoreCode component
export default function CoreCode(props) {
  console.log(props.attributes);
  return <div>CoreCode</div>;
}

CoreCode.displayName = 'CoreCode';
// This also works
// CoreCode.config.name = 'CoreCode'
```

:::note

We added a `displayName` property here to make sure that the `__typename` of the block matches this value.
For production builds, it is required to use either a `displayName="NameOfBlock"` or a `config.name="NameOfBlock"` properties for the block to resolve and render properly.

:::

This component logs the block attributes to the console via the `attributes` prop passed through the `props` parameter.

### 4.3 Create an `index.js` file inside the `wp-blocks` folder

This file will be used to import all your blocks and then make them available as the default export.

```jsx title="wp-blocks/index.js"
// import CoreCode
import CoreCode from './CoreCode';
// export blocks
export default {
  CoreCode,
};
```

:::info

By exporting the block in `index.js` we make it available to the `WordPressBlocksProvider`.

:::

### 4.4 Create the `CoreCode` block fragment

You want to create a fragment that describes the request block fields and attributes. First, `import { gql } from @apollo/client`. Then add the `CoreCode.fragments` code block. Include all relevant fields for your implementation. The `CoreCode` file so far should look like this:

```jsx title="wp-blocks/CoreCode.js" {2,9-24}
import React from 'react';
import { gql } from '@apollo/client';

export default function CoreCode(props) {
  console.log(props.attributes);
  return <div>CoreCode</div>;
}

CoreCode.fragments = {
  key: `CoreCodeBlockFragment`,
  entry: gql`
    fragment CoreCodeBlockFragment on CoreCode {
      attributes {
        borderColor
        backgroundColor
        content
        style
        textColor
        fontSize
        fontFamily
      }
    }
  `,
};
```

:::info

We chose to attach the fragment as a property of the function component itself. This follows the best practices for creating [colocated fragments](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/fragments/#creating-colocated-fragments).

:::

### 4.5 Include the block fragment in your Faust template `query` string

:::info

In our example, we use the block in both the Posts and Pages templates when using the [Faust Template Hierarchy](/docs/templates).

:::

You want to include the fragment in your Faust template `query` string and reference the block fragment `key` so that when the page resolves, the payload includes the data from that block. In this example, `single.js` is the template. You would implement this in whatever template you are working on.

```jsx {1,7,18} title="wp-templates/single.js"
import blocks from '../wp-blocks';
export default function Component(props) {
...
}
Component.query = gql`
...
${blocks.CoreCode.fragments.entry}
query GetPost(
...
	post(id: $databaseId, idType: DATABASE_ID, asPreview: $asPreview) {
		...
		editorBlocks {
			name
			__typename
			renderedHtml
			id: clientId
			parentClientId
			...${blocks.CoreCode.fragments.key}
        }
	}
...
}
```

Notice that in this template example we first `import blocks from '../wp-blocks'`. Then inside the templates gql `Component.query`, we include the fragment entry with `${blocks.CoreCode.fragments.entry}`. Then we use the key `${blocks.CoreCode.fragments.key}` inside the `GetPost`.

If you navigate to the page that contains this block, you should be able to inspect the properties in the console and see your block attributes that were logged by `console.log(props.attributes)` in `CoreCode.js`. In this case, we will see the `CoreCode` block attributes.

<img
  src="/docs/img/core-code-block-console.png"
  alt="CoreCode preview of the block attributes in the console"
/>

## 5. Implement the Block using the provided block attributes and the Editor view

Now you are ready to design the block based on the original block's look and feel.

Since the block you want to implement already consists of React elements that the Editor uses, you can review the plugin implementation of this block and try to port the parts that render the block in the frontend.

:::info

This implementation can be found in the official Gutenberg `@wordpress/block-library` package. Take a look at [this folder](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/block-library/src/code) to view the file structure and contents.

:::

### 5.1 Create required utility helper files and functions

There are 3 required utility files. Create these files in your project in the specified locations:

#### 1. `utilities/getStyles.js`

```js title="utilities/getStyles.js"
import { colorsMap, fontSizesMap } from '../styles/variables.js';
import { cssToReactStyle } from './cssToReactStyle.js';
import { compileCSS } from '@wordpress/style-engine';

export default function getStyles(attributes) {
  return {
    backgroundColor: colorsMap[attributes?.backgroundColor],
    color: colorsMap[attributes?.textColor],
    fontSize: fontSizesMap[attributes?.fontSize],
    borderColor: colorsMap[attributes?.borderColor],
    ...(attributes?.style &&
      cssToReactStyle(compileCSS(JSON.parse(attributes.style)))),
  };
}
```

This `getStyles` function takes the blocks attributes and maps them into inline React styles using the following helpers:

- `colorsMap, fontSizesMap`: Map the slug color and font values to associated colors and font sizes based on the current `theme.json`.
- `compileCSS`: A helper function from the [@wordpress/style-engine](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-style-engine/) package that parses the JSON object containing the block styles and returns an inline style string.
- `cssToReactStyle`: Another helper function that translates the inline style string into a React inline styles object.

#### 2. `utilities/cssToReactStyle.js`

```js title="utilities/cssToReactStyle.js"
import isObject from 'lodash/isObject';
import map from 'lodash/map';
import camelCase from 'lodash/camelCase';

export const cssToReactStyle = (css) => {
  // If object is given, return object (could be react style object mistakenly provided)
  if (isObject(css)) {
    return css;
  }

  // If falsy, then probably empty string or null, nothing to be done there
  if (!css) {
    return {};
  }

  // Only accepts strings
  if (typeof css !== 'string') {
    console.error(
      `Unexpected type "${typeof css}" when expecting string, with value "${css}"`,
    );
    return {};
  }

  const style = {};
  const rules = css.split(';');
  map(rules, (rule) => {
    let [key, value] = rule.split(':');

    if (key && value) {
      key = key.trim();
      value = value.trim();

      style[camelCase(key)] = value;
    }
  });

  return style;
};
```

This `cssToReactStyle` function translates the inline style string into a React inline styles object.

:::info

If you don't want to include the `@wordpress/style-engine` package in your final bundle, you can still map the JSON object manually into the associated styles.
If you take a look at this style object after the style is parsed:

```jsx title="JSON.parse(style)"
{
	border: {
		color: "#000"
	},
	color: {
		text: "#333"
	}
}
```

Mapping into the React styles object would then be:

```jsx
  const parsed = JSON.parse(style);
	return {
		borderColor: parsed?.border?.color
    color: parsed?.text?.color,
	}
```

:::

#### 3. `styles/variables.js`

```jsx title="styles/variables.js"
// Contains the Theme.js palette colors
export const colorsMap = {
  primary: '#9DFF20',
  secondary: '#345C00',
  tertiary: '#f6f6f6',
  foreground: '#000000',
  background: '#ffffff',
  'cyan-bluish-gray': '#abb8c3',
  'pale-pink': '#f78da7',
  'luminous-vivid-amber': '#fcb900',
  'pale-cyan-blue': '#8ed1fc',
  'vivid-cyan-blue': '#0693e3',
  'vivid-purple': '#9b51e0',
  'vivid-red': '#cf2e2e',
  'light-green-cyan': '#7bdcb5',
};

export const fontSizesMap = {
  small: '1rem',
  normal: '1.5rem',
  large: '1.75rem',
};
```

### 5.2 Create and import block styles

:::info

A few important things to consider here:

- First we assign the same className `wp-block-code` for the block so that we can apply the same styles as the Editor.
- Then we use our helper `getStyles` that creates the final inline styles for that block based on the block attributes.
- Finally we pass on the `props.attributes?.content` as a string to the `code` element.

:::

#### 1. Create `CoreCode.scss` and put it in `styles/blocks/CoreCode/`. It will contain the front-end block styles for this CoreCode block. If you are doing a different block or a custom block, you will create an `scss` file in `styles/blocks/` for that specific block.

```scss title="styles/blocks/CoreCode/CoreCode.scss"
.wp-block-code {
  // This block has customizable padding, border-box makes that more predictable.
  box-sizing: border-box;

  // Provide a minimum of overflow handling and ensure the code markup inherits
  // the font-family set on pre.
  code {
    display: block;
    font-family: inherit;
    overflow-wrap: break-word;
    white-space: pre-wrap;
  }
}
```

#### 2. Include the `CoreCode.scss` file inside the `styles/_blocks.scss` file:

:::info

Next.js won't allow you to import the `scss` file directly into the component since it requires all global CSS to be imported from the pages directory only. See the [related error](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/css-global) message.

So you need to either import the styles from a global module or translate the styles to use Component-Level CSS.

:::

```scss title="styles/_blocks.scss"
// WordPress block styles.
...
@import './blocks/CoreCode' // import CoreCode block styles here
```

#### 3. Finish the `CoreCode.js` component.

Import `getStyles` from `utilities`. Create and set `className` to `wp-block-code`. Create and set `styles` to `getStyles(props.attributes)` to get the proper formatting of the attributes. Add in the HTML markup for your block and use the `className` and `styles` variables for proper styling.

In this case for the `CoreCode` block, we added the `pre` and `code` markup from WordPress Core and output the contents of the block using `${props.attributes?.content}`. If you chose to complete the `CoreCode` block with us, your file should match what we have here:

```jsx title="wp-blocks/CoreCode.js"
// import react
import React from 'react';
// import graphql and our getStyles utility
import { gql } from '@apollo/client';
import getStyles from '../utilities/getStyles.js';

export default function CoreCode(props) {
  // set wp-block-code style for the markup to match core WordPress styling
  const className = 'wp-block-code';
  // use getStyles utility to process the props.attributes properly
  const styles = getStyles(props.attributes);
  return (
    // This markup is from the WordPress CoreCode block
    // add the className and styles to the markup
    // add props.attributes?.content to the markup
    <pre className={className} style={styles}>
      <code>{`${props.attributes?.content}`}</code>
    </pre>
  );
}
// add fragment
CoreCode.fragments = {
  key: `CoreCodeBlockFragment`,
  entry: gql`
    fragment CoreCodeBlockFragment on CoreCode {
      attributes {
        borderColor
        backgroundColor
        content
        style
        textColor
        fontSize
        fontFamily
      }
    }
  `,
};
CoreCode.displayName = 'CoreCode';
```

<img
  src="/docs/img/core-code-block-decoupled-preview.png"
  alt="Code block demo of the block rendered in the Faust Headless Website"
/>

:::info

Now that you have the styles configured correctly, you can navigate to your Headless Website and check that the block matches the styles in the WordPress editor. Make sure to tweak the block in the WordPress Editor and verify that the changes are being reflected in the Headless Website.

:::

---

## Further Considerations

### What if the block is missing some attributes?

If the block does not have any attributes or has only a few of them declared in the `block.json`, you can still try to extend the block API by declaring additional attributes for that block.

Follow the [filters reference guide](gutenberg/filters) to create a block that uses the `additional_block_attributes` property. The attributes will be available to query from that block.

```php
class CoreCode extends WPGraphQL\ContentBlocks\Blocks\Block
{
    protected ?array $additional_block_attributes = array(
      // Write your attributes here
    );
}
```

:::info

If you include those extensions in a custom plugin, your Headless Website application is dependent on the inclusion of this plugin. You need to make sure you bundle them together, otherwise the queries you perform in the application will fail.

:::

### Can I style the block differently?

Yes, you can style the block in many ways, choosing to ignore some of the attributes altogether. You can also use an external React Library to style the block, i.e. Material UI or ChakraUI.

Bear in mind that this will almost always result in degraded user editing experience as the styles of the WordPress Editor view won't match the styles of the rendered headless page.

### What if the block contains custom JavaScript assets?

Some Core blocks include JavaScript assets that are injected into the WordPress page so that they can run in the front view. Typically a lot of [Dynamic Blocks](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/creating-dynamic-blocks/) use that functionality since they have no way to include user interactivity. Since React is not normally bundled as a dependency in the browser, the JavaScript code usually consists of good old jQuery and document selectors.

To be able to review the bundled JavaScript assets, choose one of the following options:

- **Include them in your code:** This is not recommended as React does not play well with plain JavaScript and jQuery so you can expect lots of problems.

- **Rewrite them as React components:** You can attempt to rewrite the code into React. If the bundled code can be understood and rewritten with low effort then you can make that commitment.

- **Use an equivalent React Component from a library:** A simpler alternative is to find a compatible React Package and use that instead of trying to replicate the blocks interactivity. Sometimes this is a viable strategy as it frees the developer from implementing the functionality from scratch.

Inevitably this is a common pain point when trying to leverage the power of Blocks in the Headless Website so it's up to you how you want to handle the pros and cons of each approach.
