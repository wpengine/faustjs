title: Creating a Custom Block
description: This tutorial will give you some simple steps to follow in order to build your own completely custom block
---

In this tutorial, you will install and create a block using `@faustwp/blocks`.
This tutorial assumes you have already manually installed both the `@faustwp/blocks` and `wp-graphql-content-blocks` plugin. If you aren't sure how, head to the [Getting Started](/docs/gutenberg/getting-started) guide for step-by-step instructions.

This tutorial also utilizes the [Faust Scaffold](http://localhost:3000/blog/sprint-24-update#faustjs-scaffold) as its repository. Feel free to [clone](https://github.com/wpengine/faust-scaffold) this repository to follow along.

## 1. Do I have everything I need to create a custom block?

Before beginning, take stock of your activated plugins in your WordPress instance. Faust, WPGraphQL, and [WPGraphQL Content Blocks](/docs/gutenberg/wp-graphql-content-blocks.mdx) all need to be installed and active before you move forward. Be sure to install the `@faustwp/blocks` package at your app's root level as well.

## 2. Defining your custom block

In this tutorial, we will assume that you do not have a preexisting block in mind to use with your Decoupled site. If you have a block you want to emulate from the WordPress core blocks library, head to our [tutorial](/docs/gutenberg/tutorial/create-a-block-from-wordpress-core.mdx) to learn how to do exactly that. Likewise, if you need to recreate a block used by a third party plugin, we have a [tutorial](/docs/gutenberg/tutorial/create-a-block-from-third-party.mdx) tailored for that process, too.

This tutorial assumes that you begin your block creation from nothing at all, which will therefore require a slightly different set of steps.

## 3. Creating your block using the WordPress block boilerplate code

The [@wordpress/create-block](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/create-block) package exists to create the necessary block scaffolding to get you started. See the WordPress basic block [tutorial](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/) documentation for a step-by-step guide.

For this step, we will make a simple block named MyCoolBlock, which has a message that takes text, a radio control input attribute from the [@wordpress/components](https://wordpress.github.io/gutenberg/?path=/story/components-radiocontrol--default) library, and a RichText attribute from the [@wordpress/block-editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/richtext/) toolkit applied to another text field. This block should closely match your boilerplate code's styling:


<a href="/docs/img/custom-block-in-editor.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/docs/img/custom-block-in-editor.png"
    alt="The custom block as seen in the editor window"
  />
</a>

Your boilerplate code from `@wordpress/create-block` did not include anything in your save file, as not all blocks need a save.js in order to work. For this example, if you did not make a save.js function when you customized this block, you can follow along by looking at the following save function that was made manually while developing our example custom block. Its contents live in the plugin folder:

```jsx title="wp-content/plugins/mycoolblock/src/save.js" {6}
import { useBlockProps, RichText } from '@wordpress/block-editor';

export default function Save({attributes}) {
	return (
		<p { ...useBlockProps.save() }>
			{ `The color selected is ${attributes.color}! My favorite color: ${attributes.message}!` }
            <RichText.Content tagName="h4" value={ attributes.content }/>
        </p>
	);
}
```
Be sure to add the following in your block's `edit.js` folder as well if you wish to follow the example, so that the two files can work together to save your data:

```jsx title="wp-content/plugins/mycoolblock/src/edit.js" {6}
import { RadioControl } from '@wordpress/components';
import { RichText } from '@wordpress/block-editor';
...
export default function Edit( { attributes, setAttributes } ) {
	const blockProps = useBlockProps();
	return (
    <div {...blockProps}>
      <TextControl
        label="Which color is your favorite?"
        value={attributes.message}
        onChange={(val) => setAttributes({ message: val })}
      />
      <RadioControl
        selected={attributes.color}
        label="Color:"
        options={[
          { label: "Red", value: "red" },
          { label: "Green", value: "green" },
          { label: "Blue", value: "blue" }
        ]}
        onChange={(val) => setAttributes({ color: val })}
      />
      <RichText
        tagName="h4"
        allowedFormats={["core/bold", "core/italic", "core/strikethrough"]}
        placeholder={"Declared color..."}
        value={attributes.content}
        onChange={(val) => setAttributes({ content: val })}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Lastly, your `index.js` file will need an import statement for the `save` function, and it will need to be added to the second argument object for `registerBlockType`

```jsx title="wp-content/plugins/mycoolblock/src/index.js" {6}
registerBlockType( metadata.name, {
...
	save: Save,
} );
```

## 4. Create the initial block

Inside the codebase of your application, create the basic block structure that simply prints the block's attributes.
The steps required to achieve that are the following:

### 4.1 Save the block inside a folder called `wp-blocks`

<a href="/docs/img/creating-wp-blocks-folder.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/docs/img/creating-wp-blocks-folder.png"
    alt="The file structure of the project, showing the newly created wp-blocks folder at the root level of the Faust Scaffold app and containing a newly created folder called MyCoolBlock.js."
  />
</a>

```jsx title="wp-blocks/MyCoolBlock.js"
export default function MyCoolBlock(props) {
  console.log(props.attributes);
  return <div>MyCoolBlock</div>
}
```

This component prints the block attributes via the props passed as a parameter. This will help us understand what is happening a little later on.

### 4.2 Export the block in the `index.js`

Make another file in `wp-blocks`, called `index.js`, and place the following inside:

```jsx title="wp-blocks/index.js"
import MyCoolBlock from './MyCoolBlock';
export default {
  MyCoolBlock
}
```

By exporting the block in the `index.js`, we make it available in the `WordPressBlocksProvider`, which gives the proper context (i.e., which blocks have been defined as apart of your Faust app) to the `WordPressBlocksViewer` component. Read more about the WordPressBlocksProvider [here](http://localhost:3000/docs/reference/WordPressBlocksProvider). 

### 4.3 Create the block fragment

Next, you want to create a fragment that describes the request block fields and attributes. Ideally you want to include all the relevant attributes that this backend block function will need to call to your frontend block:

```jsx title="wp-blocks/MyCoolBlock.js" {1}
import {gql} from '@apollo/client';
...
MyCoolBlock.fragments = {
  key: `MyCoolBlockBlockFragment`,
  entry: gql`
    fragment MyCoolBlockBlockFragment on CreateBlockMycoolblock {
      attributes {
        color
        content
        message
      }
    }
  `,
};
```
We chose to attach the fragment as a property of the function component itself. This follows best practice for creating [colocated fragments](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/fragments/#creating-colocated-fragments).

Before moving forward, check to ensure your block is being queried correctly in the GraphiQL IDE. You may need to use your browser's search and find method to search all the possible names under contentBlocks.

<a href="/docs/img/graphiql-query-composer.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/docs/img/graphiql-query-composer.png"
    alt="The GraphiQL IDE is open to the Query Composer, which shows under posts, then nodes, then contentBlocks that the CreateMycoolblock is present, with a selection of attributes visible such as color, content, and message."
  />
</a>

### 4.4 Include the block fragment into the page query string

You want to include the fragment in the page query string and reference the block fragment key so that when the page resolves, the payload includes the data from that block.

In this example we will use it in the single page template provided in the Faust Scaffold. You can learn more about the Faust Template Hierarchy [here](/docs/templates).

```jsx {1,7,18} title="wp-templates/single.js"
import blocks from '../wp-blocks';
export default function Component(props) {
...
}
Component.query = gql`
...
${blocks.MyCoolBlock.fragments.entry}
query GetPost(
...
	post(id: $databaseId, idType: DATABASE_ID, asPreview: $asPreview) {
		...
		contentBlocks {
			name
			__typename
			renderedHtml
			id: nodeId
			parentId
			...${blocks.MyCoolBlock.fragments.key}
      	}
	}
...
}
```

If you navigate to the page that contains this block (here, named `localhost:3000/my-cool-block`), you should be able to inspect the properties in the console.

<a href="/docs/img/contentBlocks-in-devtools.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/docs/img/contentBlocks-in-devtools.png"
    alt="Preview of the MyCoolBlock in the console."
  />
</a>

## 5. Porting over the custom block's style.scss file

While creating your custom block using `@wordpress/create-block`, the `style.scss` file was autogenerated in your block's plugin folder. You can include these in the global styles section of your Decoupled front-end app too, if you wish:

```scss title="/MERL-742-Tutorial/styles/globals.css"
...

@font-face {
	font-family: Gilbert;
	src: url(/app/public/wp-content/plugins/mycoolblock/assets/gilbert-color.otf);
	font-weight: 700;
}

.wp-block-create-block-mycoolblock {
	font-family: Gilbert, sans-serif;
	font-size: 64px;
}
```

Now that you have the styles ported over, you can navigate into the Headless site's page and check that the block matches the styling you wish. Make sure to tweak the block in the editor and verify that the changes you want are being reflected here, too.

## Further Considerations

### Can I style the block differently?

Of course, you can style the block in many ways, choosing to ignore some of the attributes altogether.
You can also use an external React Library to style the block, such as Material UI or ChakraUI.
Bear in mind though, that this will almost always result in a differences in the editor's version of the block, versus the rendered result, as the styles in the Editor view won't match the styles of the rendered page.

### What if I want different styling upon saving the block?
`save.js`: According to [the docs](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-edit-save/#save), the `save` function defines the way in which the different attributes should be combined into the final markup, which is then serialized into `post_content`.

For an example of applying styling to saved content, take a look at [this section](https://faustjs.org/docs/gutenberg/tutorial/create-a-block-from-wordpress-core#:~:text=So%20go%20ahead%20and%20provide%20the%20implementation%20of%20the%20Block%20based%20on%20the%20save%20function.) of our core blocks creation tutorial.

:::note

Next.js won't allow you to import the `styles.scss` directly into the component since it requires all
global CSS to be imported from the pages directory only. See the [related error](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/css-global) message. You will need to either import the styles from a global module like the above, or translate the styles to use Component-Level CSS.
