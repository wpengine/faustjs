title: Setting Up Post and Page Previews
description: View WordPress preview post/page content on your headless frontend with Faust
---

Faust supports page and post previews, allowing you to view your WordPress content on the headless frontend as drafts or even before publishing.

## Set Your Headless Secret

Your headless secret is a value that authenticates requests to WordPress. This secret enables you to view content that doesn't publish on your Next.js frontend.

### Copy your Headless Secret

Find your Headless Secret in **WP-Admin -> Settings -> Headless**. Copy this value:

<img
  src="/docs/img/headless-admin-secret.png"
  alt="The Faust plugin admin interface with a red rectangle around the Secret Key field"
/>

### Add your Headless Secret to your `.env.local` File

Add the `FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY` key to your `.env.local` file with the headless secret as the value. Your `.env.local` file should already have a value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL`. The file should look something like this:

```bash title=.env.local {13}
# Your WordPress site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Plugin secret found in WordPress Settings->Headless
FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY=xxxx
```

### Ensure you've created your `faust.config.js` file and are importing it in your `_app.js`

Like the [`next/getting-started`](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/main/examples/next/faustwp-getting-started) Faust example, your [`faust.config.js`](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/blob/main/examples/next/faustwp-getting-started/faust.config.js) file.

You'll need to import it at the top of your `_app.js` file to ensure the `config` is set, and your Faust app initializes appropriately.

```js title=pages/_app.js {1}
import '../faust.config';
import React from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { FaustProvider } from '@faustwp/core';
import '../styles/global.scss';

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <FaustProvider pageProps={pageProps}>
      <Component {...pageProps} key={router.asPath} />
    </FaustProvider>
  );
}
```

## Create the Faust API Router

Next, you will need to create the `apiRouter`. This sets up the Faust API endpoints needed to authenticate requests from WordPress. Create a page at `pages/api/faust/[[...route]].js` with the following:

```js
import '../../../faust.config';
import { apiRouter } from '@faustwp/core';

export default apiRouter;
```

## Create your Preview Page

With your headless secret set and the `authorizeHandler` ready to handle requests, you can now create a Next.js [page](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for previews. Create a file at `pages/preview.js` with the following:

```js title=pages/preview.js
import { WordPressTemplate } from '@faustwp/core';

export default function Preview(props) {
  return <WordPressTemplate {...props} />;
}

```
Let's break down what is going on here:

We are using the `WordPressTemplate` component from `@faustwp/core` that will determine the correct page or post type to render based on the `wp-templates` hierarchy exports.

> **NOTE**: We don't use the `getWordPressProps` here as opposed in some other `wp-template`` pages as we want to perform post previews in the client using CSRs.

Now in the `wp-template` pages, Faust will propagate a special boolean property `asPreview=true` so your component needs to pass it on the Page `query` and `variables`.

Here is an example taken from the [`next/getting-started`](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/main/examples/next/faustwp-getting-started) Faust example of what you should do in your template hierarchy components if you wish to render previews:

```js title=wp-templates/single.js {20}
export default function Component(props) {
  // Loading state for previews
  if (props.loading) {
    return <>Loading...</>;
  }
  // Code to render Single Post template hierachy type
}
Component.query = gql`
	query GetPost(
    	$databaseId: ID!
		$asPreview: Boolean = false
	) {
    post(id: $databaseId, idType: DATABASE_ID, asPreview: $asPreview) {
		...
	}
`;
Component.variables = ({ databaseId }, ctx) => {
  return {
    databaseId,
    asPreview: ctx?.asPreview,
  };
};
```

The `variables` property contains a context  parameter `ctx` that contains the boolean value `asPreview`. This will be `true` when you are previewing a page and `false` otherwise.
We can leverage this parameter by inserting it in the `query` for requesting post or page previews.

We alson need to consider the case when the component is still loading due to the CSR request.
In such case we can render a empty or loading component when the post preview data as still in-flight:

```js
if (props.loading) {
	return <>Loading...</>;
}
```

If you don't handle the loading state you may find that the post/page data will be undefined.

### What happens if you don't use on the `asPreview` property?

If you wish to disable post/page previews for a particular template hierarchy page you can simply ignore the `asPreview` parameter.

## Navigating to Preview Pages

Start by logging into your WordPress Admin. For this example, we'll create a new post.

So far, I've added a title and a simple line of text for the content. To view this post as a preview on your front end, click the **Preview** link (1). From there, click, **Preview in new tab** (2):

<img
  src="/docs/img/post-preview.png"
  alt="WordPress post page using the Gutenberg editor with a red arrow to the preview and preview in new tab dropdowns"
/>

Notice the **Publish** button is also visible, meaning that you still need to publish the post. Therefore you can now view the post on the frontend without being authenticated.

Clicking on **Preview in new tab** should take you to your post preview page with the current preview content:

<img
  src="/docs/img/post-preview-frontend.png"
  alt="Post preview on the frontend in Next.js"
/>
