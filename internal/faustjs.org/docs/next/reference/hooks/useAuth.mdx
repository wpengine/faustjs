The `useAuth` hook provides a way to guarantee a users' authentication state, thus allowing you to control how a page's content is rendered.

The `useAuth` hook accepts 1 argument of `UseAuthOptions`, which is an object that contains the following properties:

```ts
const options = {
  // Specify if the useAuth hook should facilitate the redirect to the appropriate url.
  shouldRedirect: true;
}
```

By default, if the user is not authenticated, the page will redirect to the WordPress backend if the `authType` is `redirect`, and to the `loginPagePath` if `authType` is `local`.

However, if the `shouldRedirect` option is `false`, the `useAuth` hook will **not** facilitate the redirect.

The example below shows how to use the `useAuth` hook to render a page that requires authentication. If a user is authenticated, they will be shown the content. Otherwise, they will be redirected to the appropriate URL to authenticate:

```tsx title=src/pages/gated-content.tsx {5}
import { client } from 'client';

export default function Gated() {
  const { useAuth } = client.auth;
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return <div>Authenticated content</div>;
}
```

Additionally, the example below shows how to use `useAuth` with the `shouldRedirect` option set to `false`. This will disable the automatic redirect to the appropriate URL to authenticate, and allows you to control how the page's content is rendered in an unauthenticated state:

```tsx title=src/pages/gated-content.tsx {5-7,13-15}
import { client } from 'client';

export default function Gated() {
  const { useAuth } = client.auth;
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated, authResult } = useAuth({
    shouldRedirect: false,
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <div>You are not authenticated! Please login.</div>;
  }

  return <div>Authenticated content</div>;
}
```

`useAuth` exports an object with the following properties:

- `isLoading`: A boolean that indicates whether the `useAuth` function is currently checking if a user is authenticated.
- `isAuthenticated`: A boolean that indicates whether the user is authenticated.
- `authResult`: The result from checking if there is an authenticated user.

  If there is an authenticated user, the `authResult` will be `true`. Otherwise, the `authResult` will be an object with the following properties:

  ```js title="The authResult object when there is no authenticated user"
  {
    /**
     * An absolute URL to the WordPress backend that the user should be redirected to in order to authenticate.
     * This property is used for the "redirect" based authentication strategy
     */
    redirect: 'xxxx';

    /*
     * A relative URL path to the local login page as specified in the `loginPagePath` option.
     * This property is used for the "local" based authentication strategy
     */
    login: 'xxxx';
  }
  ```

  The `authResult` can be helpful if you want to handle the redirection yourself, instead of the `useAuth` hook.
