description: We use Telemetry in Faust.js to help us understand how users use our projects.

Faust.js has opt-in telemetry for both the FaustWP plugin and FaustNX package. The plugin and package both collect information to help us make more informed product decisions.

## What is being collected?

Once you opt-in, faust will collect the following information at build time:

### FaustNX

- Faust version
- Next.js version
- Node.js version
- Apollo Client version
- If the command is running in a development environment

### FaustWP

- WordPress version
- FaustWP version
- PHP version
- FaustWP settings (excluding any URLs)
- If the site is multisite
- If the site is hosted with WP Engine

:::info
We **do not** collect any personally identifiable information or sensitive information like environment variables, file paths, or any application URLs.
:::

## How do I enable/disable telemetry?

Telemetry in Faust.js is opt-in by default, meaning we won't collect any telemetry information unless you explicitly enable it.

If this is your first time using the `faustwp` cli, you will be prompted for your telemetry preferences:

<a href="/docs/img/telemetry-cli-prompt.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/docs/img/telemetry-cli-prompt.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the Telemetry prompt in the FaustNX package"
  />
</a>

Once your preferences have been set, you can run the following command to see the prompt again to change your preferences:

```sh
npx faustnx faustnx-telemetry
```
