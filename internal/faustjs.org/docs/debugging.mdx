## Debugging Faust

Faust has an environment variable you can set to get detailed debug information, for example, like the [seed node](/docs/faustwp/seed-query) that was returned for a given route.

To enable it, add the following environment variable to your `.env.local` file, or to the "environment variables" section on your hosting platform (Atlas, Vercel, etc).

```bash
FAUST_DEBUG=true
```

You can confirm you are in debug mode when running or building the app by viewing the console:

## Debugging Next.js

Faust is built on top of Next.js. You can learn more about debugging in Next.js by referencing their [Debugging docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/debugging).

## Debugging Apollo

Faust uses Apollo under the hood to make all GraphQL requests. Apollo has a number of developer tools, including a [Chrome and Firefox extension for examining queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/developer-tooling/#apollo-client-devtools). You can learn more about debugging with Apollo on their [Developer Tools docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/developer-tooling/).
