### Using Apollo in Faust

Faust.js uses `@apollo/client` under the hood for its GraphQL client.

You can use the client as usual in your components and pages. Take the following example:

Your app queries the `title` and `description` from `generalSettings`:

```jsx title="Your App"
import { gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

export default function Page(props) {
  const { data } = useQuery(Page.query);
  const { title, description } = data.generalSettings;
  return(
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>{description}</p>
  )
}

Page.query = gql`
  query {
    generalSettings {
      title
      description
    }
  }
`
```

It co-locates the GraphQL query within the same file. You can also import and use queries from a file.

The benefit with Faust is that you don't have to create the client object in your codebase. It is automatically created when you first import the
`@faustwp-core` package. Instead you can customize it by using a [plugin filter](https://faustjs.org/docs/plugin-system/filters).

## Generating Possible types JSON

Apollo Client v3 requires you to provide a `possibleTypes object` that maps interfaces to all their possible types.
With Faust, we provide a cli command you can use on your package.json scripts that generates this  file for you.
Just make sure to enable [WPGraphQL introspection](https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/security#introspection-disabled-by-default) before you run it.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
	"generate": "faust generatePossibleTypes",
  }
}
```

Running the command will create the following file: `possibleTypes.json`. You can commit this file to your version control system.
Now make sure you import this file to the `faust.config.js`:

```json title="faust.config.js" {11}
import { setConfig } from '@faustwp/core';
import templates from './wp-templates';
import possibleTypes from './possibleTypes.json';

/**
 * @type {import('@faustwp/core').FaustConfig}
 **/
export default setConfig({
  templates,
  experimentalPlugins: [],
  possibleTypes,
});
````

You don't have to run the command each time you build the application,
but only when you update something in the schema (by adding a new CPT for example).
