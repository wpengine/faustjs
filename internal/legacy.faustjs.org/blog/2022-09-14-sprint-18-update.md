We're 1/2 way through September and nearly finished with the first version of something completely new. This past Sprint was focused on getting the next major version of Faust ready so that we can get it in your hands by the end of this month. We're super excited about it. It's going to change everything!

## What we accomplished

The final feature of the next version of Faust was completed, post previews. This leaves us at a "code complete" point for the new version which will be ready later this month. It has all the same features as Faust currently does including authentication and post previews but adds some major new capabilities including a template system that mimics WordPress' [template hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/) and replaces GQty with the more capable [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) library to ensure your Faust-powered site can be as powerful as you need it to be.

## What's next

Sprint 19 is all about preparing for the release of the next version of Faust. The team will be splitting the code into a new repository, preparing a new site and setting up to launch the code with a brand new name.

Why a new name? The new version we're finishing up isn't just big, it's huge and a new name helps reflect that change. In addition, it helps us make sure we can continue to more easily support your existing sites already on Faust. We're excited about the change and, once we can show you more, I think you will be too.
