## Introduction

In the previous part of the tutorial, we setup a Next.js app and a WordPress instance. Now that we have our app and our WordPress instance, we can start building our app.

The framework we'll be using in this tutorial is Next.js. Next.js a React based framework, which is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is component-based, meaning that you can build user interfaces from small, re-usable blocks of code that can be composed together to build larger user interfaces.

## What is a React Component?

A React component is a JavaScript function that returns a React element. A React element is a JavaScript object that represents a DOM element.

React elements are written in a special JavaScript syntax called JSX. JSX allows you to write JavaScript code that looks like HTML.

In it's most basic form, a React component could look like this:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
};
```

Note: In TypeScript, this syntax is called TSX.

## Create a Next.js Page Component

In Next.js, a page is a React component in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route. For example, if you create a page at `pages/posts.tsx`, the route will be `/posts`.

Let's create a basic page for our `posts` route.

```tsx title=pages/posts.tsx
export default function PostsPage() {
  return <h1>My posts page</h1>;
}
```

If you visit [http://localhost:3000/posts](http://localhost:3000/posts), you'll see your new page.

  alt="A Next.js page with the text My posts page"
/>

## Create a "Post" Component

Now, let's create a React component for our posts in WordPress.

Typically, components will live in a `components` directory. This isn't a requirement, but it's a good convention.

Let's create `components/post.tsx`:

```tsx title=components/post.tsx
export default function Post() {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Post Title</h1>
      <p>Post Content</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Note: React Components must be capitalized.

This is a start, but the great thing about React components are that they are reusable. In this case, the title and content are not re-usable.

This is where [`component props`](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) come in. A React component can receive data from the parent component in the form of `props`. In this case, we want the post title and content to be passed to the `post` component.

In TypeScript, this can be done by creating an `interface` to map out the data we want to pass to the component. For example, if we wanted to pass the post title and content to the `post` component, we could do this:

```tsx title=components/post.tsx {1-4,6}
export interface PostProps {
  title: string;
  content: string;
}

export default function Post(props: PostProps) {
  const { title, content } = props;

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Just like that, we have a reusable React component. Now, we can use this component in our `posts` page.

## Create a List of Posts

Head back over to the `pages/posts.tsx` file we created earlier. Let's use our new `Post` component to create a list of posts.

First, we import our `Post` component:

```tsx title=pages/posts.tsx {1}
import Post from 'components/post';

export default function PostsPage() {
  return <h1>My posts page</h1>;
}
```

Let's also create some fake data to use in our example:

```tsx title=pages/posts.tsx {3-17}
import Post from 'components/post';

const posts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title:
      'sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit',
    content:
      'quia et suscipit suscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et reprehenderit',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'qui est esse',
    content:
      'est rerum tempore vitae sequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae',
  },
];

export default function PostsPage() {
  return <h1>My posts page</h1>;
}
```

Finally, we'll create a list of posts by looping through the `posts` array and rendering a `Post` component for each post:

```tsx title=pages/posts.tsx {23-25}
import Post from 'components/post';

const posts = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title:
      'sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit',
    content:
      'quia et suscipit suscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et reprehenderit',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'qui est esse',
    content:
      'est rerum tempore vitae sequi sint nihil reprehenderit dolor beatae',
  },
];

export default function PostsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My posts</h1>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <Post key={post.id} title={post.title} content={post.content} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Your final result will look something like:

<img
  src="/docs/img/first-react-component-result.png"
  alt="A Next.js page with a list of posts"
/>

### Key Takeaways

- React is a framework for building user interfaces with components.
- React components are JavaScript functions that return React elements.
- React elements are written in a special JavaScript syntax called JSX. JSX allows you to write JavaScript code that looks like HTML.
- React components can receive data from the parent component in the form of `props`.
- React components are used to build pages in Next.js by placing the component in a `pages` directory.

### What's Next?

In the [next tutorial, we'll configure Faust.js](./setup-faustjs), and setup the necessary WordPress plugins to transform your Next.js site into a headless WordPress site powered by Faust.js.
