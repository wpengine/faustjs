title: Expected URL Params
description: Faust.js has built-in URL params that it expects to be present in the URL, making it easier to get data from Headless WordPress.
---

When querying WordPress for data you are often going to use pieces of the current URL to determine what type of request to make. For example, if you have a list of posts in your site at `/posts` and your `Hello World` post can be found at `/posts/hello-world`, then the assumption is your `Hello World` post slug is `hello-world`. However, you still need a way to get the `hello-world` value from the URL in order to make a requests for the post. With Next.js you do this using `params` of [Static Props Context](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) or [Server Side Props Context](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering). Faust.js takes this one step further and has some predefined param names that you can use in order to have Faust.js find the URL params and make requests on your behalf. A lot of this is documented in our [hooks reference](./hooks). In general our hooks work based on an expected URL param of the content type and either `Id`, `Slug`, or `Uri` at the end. Below is the interface we look for:

```tsx
interface Params {
  postId: string;
  postSlug: string;
  postUri: string[];
  pageId: string;
  pageUri: string[];
  categoryId: string;
  categorySlug: string;
}
```

This means by building your [Next.js pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) with these params in mind, our hooks will just work without having to specify any IDs, slugs, etc.

For example, say you have a page:

```
/src/pages/posts/[postSlug].tsx
```

Since `[postSlug]` is one of the params we look for, you can use the `usePost()` hook without any arguments and it will understand that it needs to get a post using the value stored in the `postSlug` param!

```tsx title=/src/pages/posts/[postSlug].tsx {6}
import { client, getNextStaticProps } from '@faustjs/next';
import { GetStaticPropsContext } from 'next';

export default function Page() {
  const { usePost } = client();
  const post = usePost();

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post?.title()}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post?.content() }} />
    </article>
  );
}
```

The same can be done for `[postId]` only this time it will make a request using the `postId` param to get a post by ID.

```tsx title=/src/pages/posts/[postId].tsx {6}
import { client, getNextStaticProps } from '@faustjs/next';
import { GetStaticPropsContext } from 'next';

export default function Page() {
  const { usePost } = client();
  const post = usePost();

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post?.title()}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post?.content() }} />
    </article>
  );
}
```

So your code doesn't change, but your file name does. Based on what you name the file, `usePost()` will make the proper request for data. This works with `usePage()` and `usePosts()` as well. So for `usePosts()` you might have something like the following:

```tsx title=/src/pages/category/[categorySlug]/index.tsx {6}
export default function Page() {
  const { usePosts } = client();
  const posts = usePosts();

  return (
    <>
      {posts.nodes?.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.id ?? ''}>
          <div>
            <Heading level={postTitleLevel} className={styles.title}>
              <Link href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>
                <a>{post.title()}</a>
              </Link>
            </Heading>
            <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.excerpt() ?? '' }} />
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}
```

Notice the above file is `index.tsx`, but `[categorySlug]` is used in the URL. So the `usePosts()` hook will make a request using the `categorySlug` param to get posts for the category based on the value stored in `categorySlug`.
