Faust.js provides a default configuration object for your site.
This object uses as a parameter when exporting the result of the
`coreConfig` in `faust.config.js`:

```tsx
import { config as coreConfig } from '@faustjs/core';

if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL) {
  console.error(
    'You must provide a NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL environment variable, did you forget to load your .env.local file?',
  );
}

/**
 * @type {import("@faustjs/core").Config}
 */
export default coreConfig({
  wpUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL,
  apiClientSecret: process.env.FAUST_SECRET_KEY,
});
```

## Config

The Config object has the following properties:

### `wpUrl`

type: `string`

Required: `true`

This is your WordPress URL. This is typically defined in your `.env` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL`.

### `apiClientSecret`

type: `string`

Required: `true`

This is your Headless Secret key that can be retrieved from the FaustWP settings Dashboard. This is typically defined in your `.env` file as `FAUST_SECRET_KEY`.

### `gqlUrl`

type: `string`

Required: `false`

This is the value to the URL pathname of your GraphQL endpoint. This defaults to [wpurl](#wpurl) + `/graphql`.

### `apiBasePath`

type: `string`

Required: `false`

This is the value of the base API path of your endpoints for this application. This defaults to `/api/faust`.

### `authType`

type: `redirect | local`

Required: `false`

This is the value of the type of authentication you want to use. It can have two possible values: `redirect` or `local`.
When `redirect` is set, the user being redirected to WordPress to authenticate. When `local` is set,
the user initiating a login request from the Next.js application, uses the `useLogin` returns an authorization code used to request a refresh and access token.
You can read more about the authentication strategies in the [auth guide](http://localhost:3000/docs/next/guides/auth) section of the docs.

This defaults to `redirect`.

### `loginPagePath`

type: `string`

Required: `false`

This is the relative URL path of your frontend login page. This defaults to `/login`.

### `disableLogging`

type: `boolean`

Required: `false`

Set this value to `true` if you want to disable internal `console.log` statements. This defaults to `false`.

### `applyRequestContext`

type: `(url: string, init: RequestInit): Promise<RequestContext> | RequestContext`

Required: `false`

Deprecated: `true`

This property is not used anymore and has no effect. You should use this function in [getClient](/docs/next/guides/modifying-the-graphql-request) instead. This will be removed in subsequent versions of Faust.js.
