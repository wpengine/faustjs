:::caution Notice
Please note, We only collect telemetry data when using the `@faustwp/cli` package.
:::

Faust has opt-in telemetry for both the Faust plugin and Faust packages. The plugin and packages both collect information to help us make more informed product decisions.

## What is being collected?

Once you opt-in, faust will collect the following information at build time:

- Which settings are enabled/disabled in the Faust plugin
- Faust plugin version
- If the WordPress site is hosted on WP Engine
- If the WordPress site is multisite
- PHP version of the WordPress site
- WordPress version
- `@faustwp/core` version
- `@faustwp/cli` version
- `@apollo/client` version
- Node version
- Next.js Version
- If the node environment is in dev mode (was `npm run dev` ran)
- The command that is ran (i.e. `npm run dev`, `npm run build`)

:::info
We **do not** collect any personally identifiable information or sensitive information like environment variables, file paths, or any application URLs.
:::

## How do I enable/disable telemetry?

Telemetry in Faust.js is opt-in by default, meaning we won't collect any telemetry information unless you explicitly enable it.

If this is your first time using the `faust` cli, you will be prompted for your telemetry preferences:

<a href="/docs/img/telemetry-cli-prompt.png" target="_blank">
  <img
    src="/docs/img/telemetry-cli-prompt.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the Telemetry prompt in the Faust package"
  />
</a>

Once your preferences have been set, you can run the following command to see the prompt again to change your preferences:

```sh
npx faust faust-telemetry
```
