# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To create a headless WordPress site, you'll first need a WordPress instance! If you don't already have one, we recommend [Local](https://localwp.com/) to try things out locally, or you can use a live WordPress site.

You'll also need to download/activate two plugins for your WordPress site:

1. Download, upload, and activate the `wpe-headless` plugin. [(Download)](https://wp-product-info.wpesvc.net/v1/plugins/wpe-headless?download)
2. Install [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) from WordPress

### Why do I need these plugins?

#### WPE Headless

The plugin ensures that your WordPress site runs smoothly as a headless CMS. From smart content redirects to enabling post previewing to providing the right data in WPGraphQL, installing the plugin gives you the things you need to run WordPress as a headless CMS.

#### WP GraphQL

[WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) turns your WordPress site into a fully queryable GraphQL API. We use this API to communicate with the frontend.

## Usage

We've made examples for you to easily get started with the frontend framework of your choice:
