The `useLogout` hook provides a way to logout a user from your headless frontend.

The following example shows how you could use the `useLogout` hook in a `logout.tsx` page:

```tsx title="src/pages/logout.tsx"
import { client } from 'client';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
export default function Logout() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { isLoggedOut, logout } = client.auth.useLogout();
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoggedOut !== undefined) {
      return;
    }

    // Initiate the logout process.
    // This could also be called on a button click, for example, in a nav menu.
    logout();
  }, [isLoggedOut, logout]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoggedOut) {
      // The user was successfully logged out. Redirect them.
      router.push('/');
    }
  }, [router, isLoggedOut]);
  return <>Logging out...</>;
}
```

`useLogout` exports an object with the following properties:

- `logout`: a function that initiates a request to logout the user by clearing their refresh token from the cookie.
- `isLoggedOut`: `undefiend` until the `logout` function is called. Then a `boolean` that indicates whether the user was successfully logged out
- `isLoading`: A boolean that indicates whether the `logout` function is currently logging out the user.
