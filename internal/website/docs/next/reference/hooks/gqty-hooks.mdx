description: How to use the GQty related hooks for fetching data
---

There may be instances where the built in Faust.js hooks do not satisfy your data fetching requirements. Thankfully, GQty publishes the following hooks that can be used for custom queries, mutations, or subscriptions:

- [`useQuery`](https://gqty.dev/docs/react/fetching-data#usequery)
  - Make any query request to the Headless WordPress API
- [`useLazyQuery`](https://gqty.dev/docs/react/fetching-data#uselazyquery)
- [`useTransactionQuery`](https://gqty.dev/docs/react/fetching-data#usetransactionquery)
- [`useMutation`](https://gqty.dev/docs/react/mutations#usemutation)
  - Make any mutation request to the Headless WordPress API
- [`useSubscription`](https://gqty.dev/docs/react/subscriptions#usesubscription)

For example, you may want to get a list of your content types:

```tsx
const { useQuery } = client;

const contentTypes = useQuery().contentTypes()?.nodes;
```

`useQuery`, along with all the other hooks, are typed. So you'll be able to see exactly what kind of data you have access to via your IDE's intellisense.
