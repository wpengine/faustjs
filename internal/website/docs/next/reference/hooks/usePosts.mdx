<BaseUrlNotice />

The `usePosts` hook provides the standard interface for getting a list of posts from your Headless WordPress API. It also allows you to pass-in no arguments. When you do not pass arguments into `usePosts` it will attempt to look at the URL params in order to determine how to get a list of posts from your Headless WordPress API. In Next.js this means you will need to name your post page file in a particular way in order to get the proper URL params. Below are the possible names that will work automatically with Faust.js:

1. If `categoryId` is found in the URL params, a request is made to retrieve a list of posts for a `category` by `ID`
1. If `categorySlug` is found in the URL params, a request is made to retrieve a list of posts for a `category` by `SLUG`
1. If no URL params are found, a request is made to retrieve a list of posts without any filters

The following is an example of how to use the `usePosts` hook with no URL params:

```tsx title=src/pages/index.tsx {6-8,14-16}
import { getNextStaticProps } from '@faustjs/next';
import { client } from 'client';

export default function Home() {
  const { usePosts } = client;
  const posts = usePosts({
    first: 6,
  });

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Recent Posts</h2>
      <ul>
        {posts?.nodes.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title()}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

The code above will get the first 6 posts from the Headless WordPress API. If you want to create a page that would pull posts associated with a specific category you can use the following code:

```tsx title=src/pages/category/[categorySlug].tsx {6-8,14-16}
import { getNextStaticProps } from '@faustjs/next';
import { client } from 'client';

export default function Home() {
  const { usePosts } = client;
  const posts = usePosts({
    first: 6,
  });

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Recent Posts</h2>
      <ul>
        {posts?.nodes.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title()}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

The code above will get the first 6 posts from the Headless WordPress API that are for the `categorySlug` defined in the URL params.
