description: Use Faust.js' built-in authentication strategies to authenticate users from your WordPress backend
---

Authentication can be a cumbersome process when building headless WordPress sites. Thankfully, Faust.js takes care of all your authentication needs in your Next.js application.

## How It Works

**TL;DR**: Authentication in Faust.js can happen in five main steps:

1. User initiates request to authenticate data.
2. Faust.js facilitates the request for an authorization code from the FaustWP plugin. This code is a short-lived token used to request a refresh and access token.
3. Faust.js facilitates a refresh and access token request from the FaustWP plugin using the authorization code.
4. Faust.js stores the refresh token in a secure, HTTP-only cookie. The token refresh requests a new access token when the current one expires
5. Faust.js stores the access token in memory that you can use in subsequent authenticated requests.

## Initial Setup

Before you get started with implementing an authentication strategy, you'll need to setup the API Router. You can do this by creating a file, `src/pages/api/faust/[[...route]].ts`, with the following code:

```ts title=src/pages/api/faust/[[...route]].ts
import 'faust.config';
import { apiRouter } from '@faustjs/core/api';

export default apiRouter;
```

## Strategies

There are two authentication strategies available in Faust.js: `redirect` and `local`.

### Redirect Based Authentication

</a>

Redirect-based authentication is the default strategy in Faust.js. This strategy involves the user being redirected to WordPress to authenticate. Once the user has shown, the user redirects back to the Next.js application with an authorization code you can then use to request a refresh and access token, thus completing the login process.

This strategy is excellent for use cases where your authenticated users are admins/editors/etc. and do not necessarily need a "white label" login/register experience. Typically, you would use the redirect strategy if your primary reason for authentication is previewing.

Since Redirect based authentication is the default authentication method, there is no configuration needed on your end to use it. It comes out of the box, and you'll see it in action when using previews or the [`useAuth`](/docs/next/reference/hooks/useAuth) hook.

### Local Based Authentication

    src="/docs/img/auth-local-flow.png"
    alt="Diagram of the local based authentication flow"
  />
</a>

Local Based Authentication is the second strategy available in Faust.js. This strategy involves the user initiating a login request from the Next.js application via the `useLogin` hook. Upon successful login, `useLogin` returns an authorization code used to request a refresh and access token, thus completing the login process.

This strategy is excellent for use cases where you want to support a more "white label" login/register experience. This strategy routes un-authenticated requests to your specified Next.js login page. In addition, users who wish to login/register will not have to interact with WordPress or the WordPress backend at all, giving you the flexibility to implement and fine-tune your user flow.

To use this strategy, you'll need to configure your `faust.config.js` file to use the `local` authentication strategy, in addition to the route of your Next.js login page. Take the following `faust.config.js` file, for example:

```TSX title=faust.config.js {15,16}
import { config as coreConfig } from '@faustjs/core';

if (!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL) {
  console.error(
    'You must provide a NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL environment variable, did you forget to load your .env.local file?',
  );
}

/**
 * @type {import("@faustjs/core").Config}
 */
export default coreConfig({
  wpUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL,
  apiClientSecret: process.env.FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY,
  authType: 'local',
  loginPagePath: '/login',
});
```

We define the `authType` to `local` to indicate to the Faust.js config that we use the `local` strategy for authentication. We also describe the `loginPagePath` to `/login` to mark the route of the Next.js login page. This strategy redirects unauthenticated requests to the `/login` route in your Next.js application.

In your `login.tsx` page, you could take advantage of the `useLogin` hook to initiate a login request to the WordPress backend:

```tsx title=pages/login.tsx {9,18}
import { client } from 'client';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Login() {
  const { useLogin } = client.auth;
  const [usernameEmail, setUserNameEmail] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const { login, isLoading, data, error } = useLogin();

  const errorMessage = data?.error || error?.message;

  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();

        login(usernameEmail, password);
      }}
    >
      <div>
        <div>
          <label htmlFor="usernameEmail">Username or Email</label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <input
            type="text"
            value={usernameEmail}
            onChange={(e) => setUserNameEmail(e.target.value)}
            id="usernameEmail"
          />
        </div>

        <div>
          <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <input
            type="password"
            value={password}
            onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}
            id="password"
          />
        </div>

        <div>
          <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </div>
      </div>

      {errorMessage ? <p>Error: {errorMessage}</p> : null}
    </form>
  );
}
```

The `useLogin` hook exports an object with the following properties:

- `login`: a function that initiates a request to the WordPress backend for an authorization code that accepts two arguments: `usernameEmail`, which is either the user's username or email as a string, and `password` as a string.
- `isLoading`: a boolean that indicates whether the login request is in progress.
- `data`: the response data from the login request.
- `error`: the error from the login request.

For a more detailed explanation of the `useLogin` hook, see the [`useLogin` hook docs](/docs/next/reference/hooks/useLogin) .

Upon successful login, a secure, HTTP only cookie stores a refresh token and the access token in memory for subsequent authenticated requests. You can confirm a login request succeeded by checking for the `code` property in the `data` object.

Additionally, if the login page URL contains a `redirect_uri` query parameter, it will redirect the user to the specified URL upon successful login.

Finally, you can create a `logout.tsx` page to handle logout requests. This is done by using the `useLogout` hook:

```tsx title="src/pages/logout.tsx"
import { client } from 'client';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
export default function Logout() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { isLoggedOut, logout } = client.auth.useLogout();
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoggedOut !== undefined) {
      return;
    }

    // Initiate the logout process.
    // This could also be called on a button click, for example, in a nav menu.
    logout();
  }, [isLoggedOut, logout]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoggedOut) {
      // The user was successfully logged out. Redirect them.
      router.push('/');
    }
  }, [router, isLoggedOut]);
  return <>Logging out...</>;
}
```

The `useLogout` hook exports an object with the following properties:

- `logout`: a function that initiates a request to the logout middleware to remove the refresh token from the cookie.
- `isLoading`: a boolean that indicates whether the logout request is in progress.
- `isLoggedOut`: a boolean that indicates whether the logout request was successful.

## Making Authenticated Requests

In the Faust.js client, you can use `useQuery`, `usePost`, `usePage`, etc., to request the WordPress backend.

These are exported from the `client` like so:

```tsx {1,4}
import { client } from 'client';

export default function Page() {
  const { useQuery } = client;

  return(
    ...
  )
}
```

Requests using the above methodology will be un-authenticated.

To make authenticated requests, use the `auth` property exported from the `client`. This  property is essentially a replica of the `client`, except every request gets called with an access token:

```TSX {1,4,5}
import { client } from 'client';

export default function Page() {
  const { useMutation, usePreview, useAuth } = client.auth;
  const { isLoading, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <div>You are not authenticated!</div>;
  }

  return <div>Authenticated content</div>;
}
```

**Note:** The [`useAuth`](/docs/next/reference/hooks/useAuth) hook fetches the applicable tokens and ensures that the user is authenticated. Therefore, you should check for `isAuthenticated` before making authenticated requests, as doing so too early will result in a request without a valid access token.
