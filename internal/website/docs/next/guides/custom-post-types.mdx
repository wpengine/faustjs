# Interacting with Custom Post Types

Querying data in custom post types is just as easy as querying for posts or pages in Faust.js.

Before we start, if you haven't already, [setup your WordPress site for headless](../../tutorial/setup-faustjs#installing-plugins-on-wordpress).

## Create a Custom Post Type

We'll be using the [Atlas Content Modeler](https://github.com/wpengine/atlas-content-modeler) plugin to create custom post types for this guide, but you can choose to create custom post types in any way you'd like.

Atlas Content Modeler is a WordPress plugin to create custom post types and fields for headless WordPress sites. Start by downloading the plugin and activating it on your WordPress site [(Download)](https://wp-product-info.wpesvc.net/v1/plugins/atlas-content-modeler?download)

Now, navigate to WP Admin -> Content Modeler.

<img src="/docs/img/empty-content-modeler.png" alt="The Atlas Content Modeler admin interface" />

Let's create a custom post type for team members. Click the "Get Started" button, and fill out the fields to create a new Content Model. Be sure to mark "API Visibility" to "Public" so we can query the data.

<img src="/docs/img/team-members-content-modeler.png" alt="The Atlas Content Modeler admin interface with fields for a team member content type" />

## Create Fields for the Custom Post Type

Now that we've created the custom post type let's add some fields to it. From **WP-Admin -> Content Modeler**, select the Team Members custom post type.

We'll add three fields:

1. A Media field type. The name will be "Profile Pic" and the API identifier "profilePic".
2. A Text field type. The name will be "Full Name" and the API identifier "fullName". We'll also select "Use this field as the entry title".
3. A Rich Text field type. The name will be "Bio" and the API identifier "bio".

## Add Some Team Members

Now that you have created a custom post type and fields, you can start entering data. Navigate to **WP-Admin -> Team Members** to start creating!

For this example, I've created two team members, Jane and John Doe, with bios and profile pics:

## Clone the Starter Headless Project

Thus far, you have created a WordPress site with the necessary headless plugins and data. Now, we need to create a frontend app to consume this data.

We will use the getting started example project in Next.js, but the same concepts apply in other frontend frameworks.

[Follow the steps in the getting started with Next.js usage guide to create a frontend app](../getting-started.mdx)

Once your frontend app renders, the structure should look something like this:

```
my-app/
  src/
    client/
      ..
    pages/
      ..
    components/
      ..
    scss/
      ..
  public/
  .env.local
  .env.local.sample
  .env.test.sample
  .eslintrc
  .gitignore
  gqty.config.js
  next-env.d.ts
  package.json
  README.md
  tsconfig.json
```

### Regenerate the GraphQL Schema

Your schema is a TypeScript representation of your WordPress site. Since we have added some custom post types and fields, we'll want to regenerate this schema to ensure it's up to date. To restore your schema from the Next.js getting started example, run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

[Learn more about generating your client/schema here.](fetching-data.mdx)

#### Troubleshooting

##### "GraphQL introspection is not allowed"

If you run into the error message `GraphQL introspection is not allowed, but the query contained __schema or __type`, you will have to enable introspection temporarily.

[Introspection is disabled by default in WPGraphQL.](https://www.wpgraphql.com/docs/security/#introspection-disabled-by-default) To enable it, go to WP Admin -> GraphQL -> Enable Public Introspection.

If you are using something other than `WPGraphQL` you will need to refer to the documentation to enable introspection.

Once the schema file generates, you can then disable introspection again.

### Run the Dev Server

Run the following command to start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to access the starter project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Create a Team Page

We'll create a team page in `src/pages/team.tsx` to display the team members:

```tsx title=src/pages/team.tsx
import Head from 'next/head';
import { Header, Footer } from '../components';
import { client } from '../client';

export default function Team() {
  const { generalSettings } = client.useQuery();

  return (
    <>
      <Header
        title={generalSettings.title}
        description={generalSettings.description}
      />

      <Head>
        <title>Meet the Team - {generalSettings.title}</title>
      </Head>

      <main className="content content-single">
        <div className="wrap">
          <h2>Team Members</h2>
        </div>
      </main>

      <Footer copyrightHolder={generalSettings.title} />
    </>
  );
}
```

This will look something like:

<img src="/docs/img/nextjs-empty-team-members-page.png" alt="An empty web page with a large title for team members" />

### Query for Team Members

When querying custom post types in Faust.js, you can leverage the `useQuery` hook exported from the client. `useQuery` allows you to access all of WordPress' data. You'll also notice it's typed from your schema, making things super easy to find.

<img src="/docs/img/useQuery-typed.png" alt="A screenshot of the useQuery hook and its typings" />

Let's get the team members using the `useQuery` hook:

```tsx title=src/pages/team.tsx {6,8}
import Head from 'next/head';
import { Header, Footer } from '../components';
import { client } from '../client';

export default function Team() {
  const { useQuery } = client;
  const { generalSettings } = useQuery();
  const teamMembers = useQuery().teamMembers()?.nodes;

  return (
    <>
      <Header
        title={generalSettings.title}
        description={generalSettings.description}
      />

      <Head>
        <title>Meet the Team - {generalSettings.title}</title>
      </Head>

      <main className="content content-single">
        <div className="wrap">
          <h2>Team Members</h2>
        </div>
      </main>

      <Footer copyrightHolder={generalSettings.title} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Finally, we'll create a `teamMember.tsx` component to display each team member:

```tsx title=/src/components/teamMember.tsx {1}
import { TeamMember as TeamMemberType } from 'client';

interface TeamMemberProps {
  teamMember: TeamMemberType;
}

export default function TeamMember({ teamMember }: TeamMemberProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <img
        src={teamMember?.profilePic.mediaItemUrl}
        alt={teamMember?.profilePic?.altText}
      />
      <h2>{teamMember?.fullName}</h2>
      <div
        className="bio"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: teamMember?.bio }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice we are getting the `TeamMember` TypeScript type from the client and generated schema.

### Put it all Together

Finally, let's hook up the `TeamMember` component to the team page.

```tsx title=src/pages/team.tsx {4,27-29}
import Head from 'next/head';
import { Header, Footer } from '../components';
import { client } from '../client';
import TeamMember from '../components/teamMember';

export default function Team() {
  const { useQuery } = client;
  const { generalSettings } = useQuery();

  const teamMembers = useQuery().teamMembers()?.nodes;

  return (
    <>
      <Header
        title={generalSettings.title}
        description={generalSettings.description}
      />

      <Head>
        <title>Meet the Team - {generalSettings.title}</title>
      </Head>

      <main className="content content-single">
        <div className="wrap">
          <h2>Team Members</h2>

          {teamMembers.map((teamMember) => (
            <TeamMember key={teamMember.id} teamMember={teamMember} />
          ))}
        </div>
      </main>

      <Footer copyrightHolder={generalSettings.title} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Now, head back to [http://localhost:3000/team](http://localhost:3000/team) to see your WordPress data come to life!
