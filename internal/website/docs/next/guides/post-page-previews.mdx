title: Setting Up Post and Page Previews
description: View WordPress preview post/page content on your headless frontend with Faust.js
---

Faust.js supports page and post previews, allowing you to view your WordPress content on the headless frontend as drafts or even before publishing.

## Set Your Headless Secret

Your headless secret is a value that authenticates requests to WordPress. This secret enables you to view content that doesn't publish on your Next.js frontend.

### Copy your Headless Secret

Find your Headless Secre in **WP-Admin -> Settings -> Headless**. Copy this value:

<img
  src="/docs/img/headless-admin-secret.png"
  alt="The FaustWP plugin admin interface with a red rectangle around the Secret Key field"
/>

### Add your Headless Secret to your `.env.local` File

Add the `FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY` key to your `.env.local` file with the headless secret as the value. Your `.env.local` file should already have a value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL`. The file should look something like this:

```bash title=.env.local {13}
# Your WordPress site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Plugin secret found in WordPress Settings->Headless
FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY=xxxx
```

### Ensure you've created your `faust.config.js` file and are importing it in your `_app.tsx`

Like the [`next/getting-started`](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/main/examples/next/getting-started) Faust.js example, your [`faust.config.js`](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/blob/main/examples/next/getting-started/src/faust.config.js) file will live in the `src` directory.

You'll need to import it at the top of your `_app.tsx` file to ensure the `config` is set, and your Faust.js app initializes appropriately.

```tsx title=_app.tsx {1}
import 'faust.config';
import { FaustProvider } from '@faustjs/next';
import { client } from 'client';
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <FaustProvider client={client} pageProps={pageProps}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </FaustProvider>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Create the Faust.js API Router

Next, you will need to create the `apiRouter`. This sets up the Faust.js API endpoints needed to authenticate requests from WordPress. Create a page at `/src/pages/api/faust/[[...route]].ts` with the following:

```ts
import 'faust.config';
import { apiRouter } from '@faustjs/core/api';

export default apiRouter;
```

## Create your Preview Page

With your headless secret set and the `authorizeHandler` ready to handle requests, you can now create a Next.js [page](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for previews. Create a file at `/src/pages/preview.tsx` with the following:

> **NOTE**: The `usePreviewNode` was introduced in `v0.15.1` and replaces the `usePreview` hook.
From now on you should be using this hook for showing preview content.


```tsx title=src/pages/preview.tsx
import { PageComponent } from './[...pageUri]';
import { PostComponent } from './posts/[postSlug]';
import type { Page, Post } from 'client';
import { client } from 'client';

export default function Preview() {
  const { typeName, node } = client.auth.usePreviewNode();

  if (client.useIsLoading() || node === undefined) {
    return <p>loading...</p>;
  }

  if (node === null) {
    return <p>Post not found</p>;
  }

  switch (typeName) {
    case 'Page': {
      return <PageComponent page={node as Page} />
    }
    case 'Post': {
      return <PostComponent post={node as Post} />
    }
    // Add custom post types here as needed
    default: {
      throw new Error(`Unknown post type: ${typeName}`);
    }
  }
}
```

Let's break down what is going on here:

First, we are getting the `usePreviewNode` hook from the `auth` property of the `client` and we extract the typeName and node properties.

```tsx
const { typeName, node } = client.auth.usePreviewNode();
```

The `typeName` specifies the type of the node content (`Page`, `Post` or any `Custom Post Type`).
The `node` on the other hand represents the actual data for that particular node content.
Since Typescript cannot infer the type correctly (since it thinks that it's still a `Node` type), we need to cast it to the correct type before we pass it on as a property to the component.

From there, we can make a determination if the result is a page or post, and render the appropriate component:

```tsx
switch (typeName) {
  case 'Page': {
    return <PageComponent page={node as Page} />
  }
  case 'Post': {
    return <PostComponent post={node as Post} />
  }
  // Add custom post types here as needed
  default: {
    throw new Error(`Unknown post type: ${typeName}`);
  }
}
```

We abstract the page and post layouts into components to be reusable so there is no divergence between preview pages/posts and actual pages/posts.

## Navigating to Preview Pages

Start by logging into your WordPress Admin. For this example, we'll create a new post.

So far, I've added a title and a simple line of text for the content. To view this post as a preview on your front end, click the **Preview** link (1). From there, click, **Preview in new tab** (2):

<img
  src="/docs/img/post-preview.png"
  alt="WordPress post page using the Gutenberg editor with a red arrow to the preview and preview in new tab dropdowns"
/>

Notice the **Publish** button is also visible, meaning that you still need to publish the post. Therefore you can now view the post on the frontend without being authenticated.

Clicking on **Preview in new tab** should take you to your post preview page with the current preview content:

<img
  src="/docs/img/post-preview-frontend.png"
  alt="Post preview on the frontend in Next.js"
/>


> **NOTE**: If you are having problems viewing Custom Post Type (CPT) previews using the above example,
you need to make sure you have installed the latest version of the WPGraphQL plugin (> v1.6.11).
It especially contains a bug fix when the draft previews query returns null for CPTs without revisions.
