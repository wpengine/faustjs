Permalinks are "pretty URLs" of your individual blog post or page on your WordPress site. Permalinks can be modified by going to WP Admin -> Settings -> Permalinks. From there, you can modify the options to change the permalink structure to your liking.

Faust.js does not require your permalink structure to be anything specific. Instead, your permalinks should map to the structure of your [Next.js pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).

For example, your permalink structure might look like this in WordPress:

```
/posts/%postname%/
```

Therefore, your Next.js pages structure should look like this:

```bash {5,6}
my-app/
  pages/
    _app.tsx
    index.tsx
    posts/
      [postSlug].tsx
  next-env.d.ts
  package-lock.json
  package.json
  README.md
  tsconfig.json
```

Notice the `posts` directory and the accompanying `[postSlug].tsx` file. Thus, your permalink structure (`/posts/%postname%/`) map to your Faust.js site posts structure (`/posts/[postSlug]`).

As long as these two structures match, your permalink structure will work.

## Example

Lets say you wanted all of your posts to be under `/blog/`. You would modify your permalink structure to:

```
/blog/%postname%/
```

Then, in your Faust.js project, you would create a `/blog/` directory and create a `/blog/[postSlug].tsx` file for each of your posts.

```bash {5,6}
my-app/
  pages/
    _app.tsx
    index.tsx
    blog/
      [postSlug].tsx
  next-env.d.ts
  package-lock.json
  package.json
  README.md
  tsconfig.json
```
