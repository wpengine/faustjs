# Getting Started with Next.js

## Quick Start

Please install our Next.js Getting Started example using the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app \
    -e https://github.com/wpengine/headless-framework/tree/canary \
    --example-path examples/next/getting-started \
    --use-npm \
    my-app
cd my-app
```

Now, copy the sample environment template:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Finally, run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the example site!

Currently, the posts and pages you see are coming from our WordPress site at [https://headlessfw.wpengine.com](https://headlessfw.wpengine.com). In the next step, we'll show you how to hook up your own WordPress site.

## Connecting your WordPress site

The example app above loads WordPress content from the demo site at [https://headlessfw.wpengine.com](https://headlessfw.wpengine.com).

To point it to a different WordPress site, first, [make sure you have setup the necessary WordPress plugins.](../tutorial/setting-up-wordpress.mdx)

Once the necessary plugins have been installed, open the `.env` file you created earlier, it should look something like this:

```bash
# Your WordPress site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=https://headlessfw.wpengine.com

# Plugin secret found in WordPress Settings->Headless
WP_HEADLESS_SECRET=YOUR_PLUGIN_SECRET
```

Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` value with your WordPress site URL (be sure to include `http://` or `https://`).

Additionally, update the `WP_HEADLESS_SECRET` value with the secret key found in Settings â†’ Headless in your WordPress admin area to support previews.
