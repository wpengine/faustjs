# Getting Started with Next.js

## Quick Start

Please install our Next.js Getting Started example using the following command:

### On MacOS, Linux, or WSL (bash):

```bash
npx create-next-app \
    -e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/main \
    --example-path examples/next/getting-started \
    --use-npm \
    my-app
cd my-app
```

### On Windows with [Powershell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7.1):

```ps
npx create-next-app `
    -e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/main `
    --example-path examples/next/getting-started `
    --use-npm `
    my-app && cd my-app
```

> NOTE: If you are on Windows, we suggest using [Powershell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7.1) and [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701).

Now, copy the sample environment template:

```bash
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
```

Finally, run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the example site!

Currently, the posts and pages you see are coming from our WordPress site at [https://headlessfw.wpengine.com](https://headlessfw.wpengine.com). In the next step, we'll show you how to hook up your own WordPress site.

## Connecting your WordPress site

The example app above loads WordPress content from the demo site at [https://headlessfw.wpengine.com](https://headlessfw.wpengine.com).

To point it to a different WordPress site, first, [make sure you have setup the necessary WordPress plugins.](../tutorial/setup-faustjs#installing-plugins-on-wordpress)

Once the necessary plugins have been installed, open the `.env.local` file you created earlier, it should look something like this:

```bash
# Your WordPress site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=https://headlessfw.wpengine.com

# Plugin secret found in WordPress Settings->Headless
FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_PLUGIN_SECRET
```

Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` value with your WordPress site URL (be sure to include `http://` or `https://`).

Additionally, update the `FAUSTWP_SECRET_KEY` value with the secret key found in Settings â†’ Headless in your WordPress admin area to support previews.

## Setting Your Permalinks

Finally, set your permalinks to the following structure in WP Admin -> Settings -> Permalinks:

```
/posts/%postname%/
```

You can learn more about modifying your permalink structure by viewing the [Permalinks Guide](/docs/next/guides/permalinks).
