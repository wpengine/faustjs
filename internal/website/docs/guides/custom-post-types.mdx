# Interacting with custom post types

Querying data in custom post types is just as easy as querying for posts or pages in the framework.

Before we start, if you haven't already, [setup your WordPress site for headless](/getting-started/setting-up-wordpress).

## Create a custom post type

We'll be using the [Atlas Content Modeler](https://github.com/wpengine/atlas-content-modeler) plugin to create custom post types for this guide, but you can choose to create your custom post types in any way you'd like.

Atlas Content Modeler is a WordPress plugin to create custom post types and fields for headless WordPress sites. Start by downloading the plugin and activating it on your WordPress site [(Download)](https://wp-product-info.wpesvc.net/v1/plugins/atlas-content-modeler?download)

Now, navigate to WP Admin -> Content Modeler.

Let's create a custom post type for our team members. Click the "Get Started" button, and fill out the fields to create a new Content Model. Be sure to mark "API Visibility" to "Public" so we can query the data.

## Create fields for your custom post type

Now, that we've created our custom post type, let's add some fields to it. From WP Admin -> Content Modeler, select the Team Members custom post type.

We'll add three fields:

1. A Media field type. The name will be "Profile Pic" and the API identifier "profilePic"
2. A Text field type. The name will be "Full Name" and the API identifier "fullName". We'll also select "Use this field as the entry title"
3. A Rich Text field type. The name will be "Bio" and the API identifier "bio".

## Create some team members

Now that you have created a custom post type and fields, you can start entering data. Navigate to WP Admin -> Team Members to start creating!

For this example, I've created two team members, Jane and Jonh Doe, with bios and profile pics:

## Create your starter headless project

From here, you have your WordPress site setup with the necessary headless plugins, and data. Now, we need to create a frontend app to consume this data.

We are going to use a starter project in Next.js, but the same concepts apply in other frontend frameworks.

[Follow the steps in our Getting started with Next.js usage guide to create a frontend app.](/next/getting-started)

Once your frontend app is created, the structure should look something like this:

```
my-app/
  src/
    client/
      ..
    pages/
      ..
    components/
      ..
    scss/
      ..
  public/
  .env.local
  .env.local.sample
  .env.test.sample
  .eslintrc
  .gitignore
  gqless.config.js
  next-env.d.ts
  package.json
  README.md
  tsconfig.json
```

### Regenerate your schema

Your schema is a TypeScript representation of your WordPress site. Since we have added some custom post types and fields, we'll want to regenerate this schema to ensure it's up to date. To regenerate your schema from the Next.js starter, simply run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

[Learn more about generating your client/schema](next/generating-client)

### Run the dev server

Run the following command to start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to access the starter project at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Create a team page

We'll create a team page in `src/pages/team.tsx` to display our team members:

```tsx title="src/pages/team.tsx"
import Head from 'next/head';
import { Header, Footer } from '../components';
import { client } from '../client';

export default function Team() {
  const { useGeneralSettings } = client;
  const generalSettings = useGeneralSettings();

  return (
    <>
      <Header
        title={generalSettings.title}
        description={generalSettings.description}
      />

      <Head>
        <title>Custom Page - {generalSettings.title}</title>
      </Head>

      <main className="content content-single">
        <div className="wrap">
          <h2>Team Members</h2>
        </div>
      </main>

      <Footer copyrightHolder={generalSettings.title} />
    </>
  );
}
```

This will look something like:

<img src="/docs/img/nextjs-empty-team-members-page.png" alt="An empty web page with a large title for team members" />

### Query for team members

When querying for custom post types, you can leverage the `useQuery` hook that is exported from the client. This allows you to access all of WordPress' data. You'll also notice it's typed from your schema, making things super easy to find.

<img src="/docs/img/useQuery-typed.png" alt="A screenshot of the useQuery hook and its typings" />

Let's get our team members using the `useQuery` hook:

```tsx title="src/pages/team.tsx" {6,8}
import Head from 'next/head';
import { Header, Footer } from '../components';
import { client } from '../client';

export default function Team() {
  const { useGeneralSettings, useQuery } = client;
  const generalSettings = useGeneralSettings();
  const teamMembers = useQuery().teamMembers()?.nodes;

  return (
    <>
      <Header
        title={generalSettings.title}
        description={generalSettings.description}
      />

      <Head>
        <title>Custom Page - {generalSettings.title}</title>
      </Head>

      <main className="content content-single">
        <div className="wrap">
          <h2>Team Members</h2>
        </div>
      </main>

      <Footer copyrightHolder={generalSettings.title} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Finally, we'll create a `teamMember.tsx` component to display each team member:

```tsx title="/src/components/teamMember.tsx"
import { TeamMember as TeamMemberType } from 'client';

interface TeamMemberProps {
  teamMember: TeamMemberType;
}

export default function TeamMember({ teamMember }: TeamMemberProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <img
        src={teamMember?.profilePic.mediaItemUrl}
        alt={teamMember?.profilePic?.altText}
      />
      <h2>{teamMember?.fullName}</h2>
      <div
        className="bio"
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: teamMember?.bio }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice how we are getting the `TeamMember` type from the client and generated schema.

### Put it all together

Finally, let's hook up our `TeamMember` component to the Team page.

```tsx title="src/pages/team.tsx" {4,27-29}
import Head from 'next/head';
import { Header, Footer } from '../components';
import { client } from '../client';
import TeamMember from '../components/teamMember';

export default function Team() {
  const { useGeneralSettings, useQuery } = client;
  const generalSettings = useGeneralSettings();

  const teamMembers = useQuery().teamMembers()?.nodes;

  return (
    <>
      <Header
        title={generalSettings.title}
        description={generalSettings.description}
      />

      <Head>
        <title>Meet the Team - {generalSettings.title}</title>
      </Head>

      <main className="content content-single">
        <div className="wrap">
          <h2>Team Members</h2>

          {teamMembers.map((teamMember) => (
            <TeamMember key={teamMember.id} teamMember={teamMember} />
          ))}
        </div>
      </main>

      <Footer copyrightHolder={generalSettings.title} />
    </>
  );
}
```

Now, head back over to [http://localhost:3000/team](http://localhost:3000/team) to see your WordPress data come to life!
