description: We use Telemetry in Faust.js to help us understand how users use our projects.

Faust.js has opt-in telemetry for both the FaustWP plugin and FaustNX package. The plugin and package both collect information to help us make more informed product decisions.

## What is being collected?

### FaustWP

The FaustWP plugin collects the following information:

- WordPress version
- WPGraphQL version
- FaustWP version
- PHP version
- If the site is multisite

### FaustNX

The FaustNX package collects the following information:

- FaustNX version
- Next.js version
- Node.js version
- Apollo Client version
- If the command is running in a development environment

:::info
We **do not** collect any personally identifiable information or sensitive information like environment variables or file paths.

## How do I enable/disable telemetry?

Telemetry in Faust.js is opt-in by default, meaning we won't collect any telemetry information unless you explicitly enable it.

### FaustWP

The FaustWP plugin has a setting under WP Admin -> Settings -> Headless, called "Enable usage tracking". Toggling this option will enable/disable telemetry in the plugin.

### FaustNX

If this is your first time using the `faustnx` cli, you will be prompted for your telemetry preferences:

  />
</a>

Once your preferences have been set, you can run the following command to see the prompt again to change your preferences:

```sh
npx faustnx faustnx-telemetry
```
