Faust.js has opt-in telemetry for both the FaustWP plugin and FaustNX package. The plugin and package both collect information to help us make more informed product decisions.

## What is being collected?

### FaustWP

The FaustWP plugin collects the following information:

- WordPress version
- WPGraphQL version
- FaustWP version
- PHP version
- If the site is multisite

### FaustNX

The FaustNX package collects the following information:

- FaustNX version
- Next.js version
- Node.js version
- Apollo Client version
- If the command is running in a development environment

## How do I enable/disable telemetry?

Telemetry in Faust.js is opt-in by default, meaning we won't collect any telemetry info unless you explicitly enable it.

### FaustWP

The FaustWP plugin has a setting under WP Admin -> Settings -> Headless called "Opt into anonymous usage tracking to help us make Faust.js better". Toggling this option will enable/disable telemetry in the plugin.

### FaustNX

If this is your first time using the `faustnx` cli, you will be prompted for your telemetry preferences:

Once you have set your preferences, you can run the following command to toggle your telemetry preferences:

```sh
npx faustnx faustnx-telemetry
```
