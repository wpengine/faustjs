title: Create A Basic Headless WordPress Site
description: In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of creating a basic headless WordPress site using Next.js and Local.
---

In the previous tutorial, we set up our development environment to create JavaScript/TypeScript apps efficiently.

Now, we will create our frontend web app using Next.js, and spin up an instance of WordPress.

## Create a Next.js App

Next.js offers a handy CLI tool called `create-next-app` to help us create a basic Next.js app.

To get started, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
```

If prompted to `create-next-app`, enter `y' to continue.

Great! You've deployed your app! However, it's not quite ready for TypeScript yet. Let's do that now.

### Setup TypeScript

Start by `cd'ing into your app directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

Now, run:

```bash
touch tsconfig.json
```

This command creates your [TypeScript config file.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)

Now, let's install TypeScript and our dependencies.

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react
```

Once the dependencies are installed, run `npm run dev` to start the development server. Doing this will automatically generate the settings needed for `tsconfig.json`.

Now, convert your existing pages to TypeScript:

Rename `pages/_app.js` to `pages/_app.tsx`, and replace the contents with the following:

```jsx title=_app.tsx
import '../styles/globals.css';

import type { AppProps /*, AppContext */ } from 'next/app';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

Additionally, rename, `pages/index.js` to `pages/index.tsx`.

Your Next.js site is now ready for TypeScript! Let's move on to WordPress.

## Create a WordPress Site

Now that we have created a Next.js app, we can create a WordPress site. We use [Local](https://localwp.com) to spin up instances of WordPress locally.

Download and install Local from https://localwp.com. Once installed, click the `+` button in the bottom left corner of the screen.

Follow the onboarding process to create a new WordPress site.

You can then copy the "Site Domain" and visit your new WordPress site directly.

### Key Takeaways

  - We used `create-next-app` to create a Next.js app
  - We installed and setup TypeScript on a basic Next.js app
  - We created a WordPress site using Local

### What's Next?

In the next tutorial, we'll [create our first React component](./first-react-component)!
