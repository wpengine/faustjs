title: Create A Basic Headless WordPress Site
description: In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of creating a basic headless WordPress site using Next.js and Local.
---

:::tip

You can now save most of the following steps by using the **Local Atlas extension** that enables an effortless experience spinning up a WordPress instance with an accompanying Faust.js frontend.
Just follow the steps outlined in the [**relevant help docs**](https://localwp.com/help-docs/local-add-ons-help/using-the-atlas-headless-wp-add-on/).
With this add-on enabled, you will be able to install [**Blueprints**](https://localwp.com/help-docs/local-add-ons-help/what-are-atlas-blueprints/)
which are pre-built headless WordPress sites designed to work seamlessly with WP Engine's Atlas hosting platform and are useful for testing.

In the previous tutorial, we set up our development environment to create JavaScript/TypeScript apps efficiently.

Now, we will create our frontend web app using Next.js, and spin up an instance of WordPress.

## Create a Next.js App

Next.js offers a handy CLI tool called `create-next-app` to help us create a basic Next.js app.

To get started, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
```

If prompted to `create-next-app`, enter `y` to continue.

Great! You've deployed your app! However, it's not quite ready for TypeScript yet. Let's do that now.

### Setup TypeScript

Start by `cd`ing into your app directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

Now, create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory of your app with the following:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

:::note

We're setting the `baseUrl` to `.` so we can import files relative to the root of our app. For example: <br />
`import 'styles/globals.css'` instead of `import '../styles/globals.css'`

:::

Now, let's install TypeScript and our dependencies.

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

Once the dependencies are installed, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will automatically generate the rest of the settings needed for `tsconfig.json`, and start the development server.

Congrats! You've setup TypeScript within your project. Let's now convert your existing JavaScript pages to TypeScript pages:

Rename `pages/_app.js` to `pages/_app.tsx`, and replace the contents with the following:

```jsx title=_app.tsx
import 'styles/globals.css';

import type { AppProps /*, AppContext */ } from 'next/app';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

Additionally, rename, `pages/index.js` to `pages/index.tsx`.

Your Next.js site is now ready for TypeScript! Let's move on to WordPress.

## Create a WordPress Site

Now that we have created a Next.js app, we can create a WordPress site. We use [Local](https://localwp.com) to spin up instances of WordPress locally.

Download and install Local from [https://localwp.com](https://localwp.com). Once installed, click the `+` button in the bottom left corner of the screen.

Follow the onboarding process to create a new WordPress site.

You can then copy the "Site Domain" and visit your new WordPress site directly.

### Key Takeaways

- We used `create-next-app` to create a Next.js app
- We installed and setup TypeScript on a basic Next.js app
- We created a WordPress site using Local

### What's Next?

In the next tutorial, we'll [create our first React component](./first-react-component)!
