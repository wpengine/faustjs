## Next.js Introduction

Faust.js offers helper functions and tools for building applications using Next.js.
This section of the tutorial goes through the basic features of this framework.

### What is Next.js?

Simply stated, Next.js is a React Framework for developing Single Page Applications (SPAs).
It is an [open-source](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) project that provides many abstractions and helper functions
to enable delivering truly production ready React Applications. With Next.js developers don't have to think too much about
optimizing for performance, server rendering, asset optimization or configuration.

### What are the benefits of Next.js?

Next JS comes with many features out of the box.
It's been around for some time and has significant adoption rate given that a lot of new web applications are build in React.

Some of its main features include:

* **Support for many rendering patterns**: Including Server Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Generation (ISR)
* **Zero Config**: It includes scripts to build your application for production without specifying any configuration.
* **Build-in Optimized Image Components**: It offers the [Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) component that handles automatic lazy-loading, preloading of critical images, correct sizing across devices, and automatically supports modern formats.

The full list of Next.js features can be summarised in this [page](https://nextjs.org/#features).

### How Next.js works

Next.js provides many abstractions and building blocks to create web applications in React.
It handles the tooling, configuration and background work, relieving the developers for tackling those tasks on their own.
In exchange, it requires developers to follow specific conventions. Let's take a look at the most important ones:

#### Folder Structure

In Next.js, each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

Example: If you create `pages/about.js` that exports a React component like below, it will be accessible at `/about`.

```jsx
function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}

export default About
```
Notice here that you don't have to `import React` as Next.js will perform the JSX->JS compilation behind the scenes.
You just need to export a default JSX Component and will use it as the main page content. You can read more about how [routing works here](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).

#### Automatic Static Optimization

Next.js will automatically determine that a page is static based on the presence or absence of `getServerSideProps` and `getInitialProps` in the page.
If `getServerSideProps` or `getInitialProps` is present in a page, Next.js will switch to render the page on-demand, per-request doing SSR.

```jsx
function About(props) {
  return <div>{props.message}</div>
}

export default About

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  return {
    props: {
      message: "About",
    }, // will be passed to the About page component as props
  }
}
```

You can read more about how [Automatic Static Optimization works here](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization).


#### API Route Handlers

You can build API's with Next.js by creating files inside the `pages/api` folder.
For example, the following API route `pages/api/user.js` returns a json response with a status code of 200:

```js
export default function handler(req, res) {
	res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello' })
}
```
Any request to the `/api/user` will respond with the JSON payload: `{"message":"Hello"}`.
The handler function here will run on the server side and no actual code is exposed to the client. You can read more about how [API Routes works here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

## What's Next?

Now that you have a basic overview of Next.js, in the next step you are going to setup a [basic headless site](./basic-headless-site).
