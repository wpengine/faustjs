# Setting Up WordPress

## WordPress

To create a headless WordPress site, you'll first need a WordPress instance! If you don't already have one, we recommend [Local](https://localwp.com/) to try things out locally, or you can use a live WordPress site.

## Plugins

You'll also need to download/activate two plugins for your WordPress site:

1. Download, upload, and activate the `wpe-headless` plugin. [(Download)](https://wp-product-info.wpesvc.net/v1/plugins/wpe-headless?download)
2. Install [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) from WordPress

### Why do I need these plugins?

#### WPE Headless

The plugin ensures that your WordPress site runs smoothly as a headless CMS. From smart content redirects to enabling post previewing to providing the right data in WPGraphQL, installing the plugin gives you the things you need to run WordPress as a headless CMS.

#### WP GraphQL

[WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) turns your WordPress site into a fully queryable GraphQL API. We use this API to communicate with the frontend.

### Set your headless frontend URL

Now that you have the plugins installed, navigate to Settings -> Headless and set your Front-end site URL. This is the URL where your frontend will live. For local development this will usually be something like `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

Now that you have WordPress setup to support headless, you can now use the framework! We've made guides to easily get you started with the frontend framework of your choice:
