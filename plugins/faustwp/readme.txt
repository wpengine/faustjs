Faust.js™ transforms your traditional WordPress installation into a flexible headless CMS.

== Description ==

In conjunction with the [Faust.js™ NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40faustwp), the Faust.js™ WordPress plugin enables a decoupled front-end to authenticate with WordPress through GraphQL mutations and REST API endpoints. It is the bridge between a Faust.js™ powered front-end application, and a WordPress backend.

The plugin also provides useful options for headless sites, such as the ability to:

- Hide “theme” admin pages.
- Redirect public route requests to the front-end application.
- Rewrite WordPress URLs to front-end URLs in queried content.

== Installation ==

1. Search for the plugin in WordPress under "Plugins -> Add New".
2. Click the “Install Now” button, followed by "Activate".

That's it! For more information on getting started with headless WordPress, see [Getting Started with Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/docs/tutorial/dev-env-setup).

= Why the name “Faust.js”? =

Johann Faust was a German printer and was instrumental in the invention of the printing press, along with his partner Johann Gutenberg. In the same way the printing press democratized the spread of information, the mission of Faust.js is to support and further the vision of WordPress to democratize publishing on the web.
