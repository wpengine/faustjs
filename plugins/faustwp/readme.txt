FaustWP transforms your traditional WordPress installation into a flexible headless CMS.

== Description ==

In conjunction with Faust.js, FaustWP enables a decoupled front-end to authenticate with WordPress through GraphQL mutations and REST API endpoints. It is the connective glue between a Faust.js-powered front-end app, and a WordPress backend.

The plugin also provides useful options for headless sites, such as the ability to:
<ul>
<li>Hide “theme” admin pages.</li>
<li>Redirect public route requests to the front-end application.</li>
<li>Rewrite WordPress URLs to front-end URLs in queried content.</li>
</ul>

== Installation ==

1. Search for the plugin in WordPress under "Plugins -> Add New".
2. Click the “Install Now” button, followed by "Activate".

That's it! For more information on getting started with headless WordPress, see <a href="https://faustjs.org/docs/tutorial/dev-env-setup" target="_blank">Getting Started with Faust.js</a>.
